Hi! I am a humble Maid! My master has a big heart to match his big belly. He's a gourmet! So I am looking for ingredients that will make his heart jump for joy!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff... Oh, that aroma! It smells so gourmet! Do you have a wonderful ingredient in your Bag? Would you consider selling it to me?
Oh, it smells so good! That VAR(265, 0) of yours is a very rare ingredient indeed! Would you take $VAR(519, 1) for it?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
Merci! Thank you!! With this, I can create a superb menu. My master will be so surprised!
Hmm... This is not quite what I'm looking for. I don't think my master will be satisfied with such a smell...
Aww... Well, that's OK. If you find a gourmet ingredient for me, please let me know!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff... Well, I don't smell anything interesting in your Bag. But if you find a gourmet ingredient, please let me know!
Ore, ore, ore... Ores that I adore! Ah, this is where you should laugh... Anyway... I will pay you well for rare ores. And not just ores! Stones, gems, shards...anything mineral! I love it all!
Don't you have an adorable ore that shakes my core?
Oh, I do adore the ores! That VAR(265, 0), it's shaking me! Will you sell it for $VAR(519, 1)?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
The deal is done! I've scored an ore I can adore!
Huh? What on earth is this? You can't shake my core with an ore so poor!
Hmmm. My core won't change. I hope you sell it to me someday.
Don't you have an adorable ore that shakes my core? Hmmmm. You don't seem to have it. Come back again.
As you can see, I am an ultrarich billionaire! And as you can see, my hobby is to collect rare items! In fact, this outfit is ultra expensive and rare. Can you see it? Can you?
There's something that this billionaire wants to get his hands on, even if it means spending a lot of money. Do you have such a rare item? Do you?
That VAR(265, 0)!! Will you sell it to me for $VAR(519, 1)? Will you?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
I got a very good item! Don't you think it's great? Don't you?
This is slightly different. Don't you think so, too? Don't you?
If you ever change your mind, will you sell me the rare item? Will you?
Actually, it's... It's a rare treasure, Relic Crown! I was told it was at the innermost part of the Abyssal Ruins! I think it is understandable that you want to treasure it, but will you sell it to me for $VAR(519, 1)? Will you?
There's something that this billionaire wants to get his hands on, even if it means spending a lot of money. Do you have such a rare item? Do you? Grrr! You don't have a rare item, do you?
Hey, check it out. I've got a sweet deal for ya! You know how Pokémon like to hide behind stones or rocks, yeah? Sometimes they hide cool stuff, too. If you find something cool behind a rock, you should bring it to me. I'll make it worth your while.
What's up? Did you find something cool for me?
Hey, nice! Let me check out that VAR(265, 0)... I'll give you $VAR(519, 1) for it. Whaddaya say?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
Hey, thanks! I bet I can sell this to a collector for way more than I just gave you. Ha! That's business for ya!
Nope, this is no good. Not worth my while.
Hey, come see me if you find something cool, got it? I'll make it worth your while.
What's up? Did you find something cool for me? ...Nope, nothing cool in your Bag. Oh well. Maybe next time!
I work on a farm in Mistralton City. So I need lots of Mulch! So much Mulch! You're a Pokémon Trainer, right? Do you know much about Hidden Grottoes? You can sometimes find Mulch deep inside Hidden Grottoes! Lots of Mulch! So much Mulch! Mulch is great! I have much love for Mulch!
You have Mulch, don't you? How much Mulch? Will you show it to me?
Sniff, sniff, sniff... This smell... It's VAR(265, 0), isn't it? I'll pay this much for that Mulch: $VAR(519, 1). How about it?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
Sniff, sniff, sniff... This Mulch has an exquisite smell! So much aroma! So much excitement!
Sniff, sniff, sniff... This doesn't smell right! If it's not Mulch, I can't buy it. Nothing excites me as much as Mulch!
Mulch is important for farms and fields! Mulch helps things grow so much! If you find Mulch, even if it's not much, please bring it to me!
Sniff, sniff, sniff... I don't smell anything. You don't have Mulch, do you? Bring me some next time! Bring me a lot! I need so much Mulch!

Dave: People who've got it goin' on always get what they want! If there's a Pokémon you want to catch, keep on goin' on! You gotta get whatcha want the right way--honestly and thoroughly!
Dave: There's a shop where those who've got it goin' on go. I heard they got some new items in recently.
Dave: Used to be a lot of thugs hangin' around here looking for cash. I drove most of them off! Yeah! That's right!

Karenna: You're VAR(256, 0), right? It sounds like you've conquered a lot of the Black Tower! I won't lose either!
Karenna: Congratulations on clearing the Black Tower, VAR(256, 0)! Everyone's talking about you! I even heard the shops have new items commemorating your victory!
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Marie: I came to Black City to write my thesis. The theme of my research is Pokémon that live in cities. I came to research the soothing effect Pokémon have on tired urban dwellers!
Marie: I've finally organized the research I've been doing in Black City!

Piper: I managed to get a job at one of the best companies in Black City, which is full of amazing businesses! I'm going to work really hard and move up through the ranks!
Piper: I can't take it! I'm done! Waaah! Sigh... I keep making mistakes at work, I got dumped... I want to run away to White Forest and relax in the woods with Pokémon.
Piper: The other day, I solved a big problem at work! Everyone complimented me! ♪ A lot has happened recently, but I'm glad I stuck with my job! I'll keep making money here in Black City!

Collin: There's something I want, but it is never in stock at the shops. The guy at one of the shops said they would have it in stock soon. But I just can't wait!
Collin: Have you been to the shop? They got a new item in stock! But it's still not the item I want... If I don't get my hands on it soon, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble!
Collin: They finally got what I wanted in stock! I've waited so long for this! ...Huh? What did I want? That's kind of a nosy question! I'll never tell you!
       
Ken: Unova's Challenge... Trainers come from all over the world to challenge the Black Tower. Are you taking it on too, VAR(256, 0)? A difficult battle lies ahead! Take some amazing Pokémon with you!
Ken: I heard about your exploits in Unova's Challenge, the Black Tower! But don't get cocky! The higher the area, the odder the Trainers get... Well, that was my experience anyway. Do your best and aim for the top!
Ken: You finally overcame Unova's Challenge, the Black Tower! VAR(256, 0)... You are truly amazing! I've tried many times myself, but I failed every time, and before long, I gave up. I respect you for believing in your Pokémon and yourself!
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Emi: When I'm not at my part-time job, I make piles of prize money by battling in the Black Tower! I'm glad I came here. I like quiet places, but... I couldn't make money like this in White Forest.
Emi: I hear you made it pretty far up in the Black Tower? That's really amazing! I couldn't get past the first area! Still, I can make a lot of money there, so I don't really mind.
Emi: Even if I'm making good money, I've never lived in the same place for this long before... I've met a lot of people and found some shops I really like. But it's about time for me to leave. Maybe it would be nice to go to White Forest and relax for a while.

Welcome to Black City. This is the city of dreams, greed, and more greed. And I am Black City's boss, so I'm a whirlpool of greed!
Your greed is impressive. I know. You climbed right up the Black Tower. That's great! I like people who are filled with ambition and greed.
Having amazing Trainers like you here in Black City makes me seem less impressive. But, whatever! My greed knows no bounds... That's right! That's why I'm the boss of Black City!
It has worth because it's expensive. If you think that, you'll get burned! You have to get smarter so you won't get tricked!
I want to become really powerful so I can make more money!
Money can't get you everything. Still, if you have it, you can get almost anything!
You can't be satisfied by being the same as everyone else! If you are, you're just not thinking, and you'll be tricked by bad people.
Hmmm... Isn't there a better job where I can make more money? I mean, come on! I want more money if I'm going to do the same job!
I wonder how strong this Pokémon could become... Strength is a measure of worth, right?
Everything I want is here! If I only had money! If only! That's right! I'm going to work hard to make money!
Did civilization develop so that people can get what they want?

This is a delicious restaurant where you can also enjoy Pokémon battles!
Well, I'll be! Those are some sparkling Gym Badges! And you have eight of them, too! Those Badges shine so brightly, it's like you're gleaming as much as they are!
I still haven't defeated the Striaton City Gym Leaders... But that's all right. I'm going to become such a strong Trainer, they'll want to challenge me!
If a Pokémon type and a move type are the same, the move's power will increase! If the Pokémon is holding a gem of that type, the move's power goes up yet more!
From the factory's once-busy days, many dreams still linger in the Dreamyard. A Pokémon led there by those dreams may be somewhere about.
When I explain to someone what I learned at school, I'm more connected to people, thanks to Pokémon!
Technical Machines can be used over and over, right? I tried so many different things! It's sure hard to decide, eh?
Er... Um... Grass-type Pokémon are weak against Fire-type moves. That's why Cilan has trouble winning against Chili!
Er... Um... Water-type Pokémon are weak against Grass-type moves. That's why Cress has trouble winning against Cilan.
Um... Er... Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type moves. That's why Chili has trouble winning against Cress.
The Gym is gone, but the Dreamyard still bustles with Trainers looking to improve!
Hm... I'd like to give you this!
To live quietly and do a lot of fishing... I truly live my ideal existence...
There are times when you want to catch Pokémon in dark places, right? I'll share some of these with you.
A Dusk Ball works well at night or in a cave. Plus, it has a most excellent name! Dusk! The Dusk Ball. I believe it can even catch and control the darkness found in hearts.
Oh, my! Your Medal Box...
The orange Adventure Medals are particularly sparkly! Life is an adventure! No matter how old you get, don't lose your sense of adventure!
The blue Battle Medals are particularly sparkly! In life, you have to draw a line between black and white. Compete, aim for the top, and grow together!
The pink Fun Medals are particularly sparkly! Life is entertainment! Always have a smile on your face! The one who has the most fun wins!
The purple Challenge Medals are particularly sparkly! Life is a challenge! The harder it is to do, the more it's worth doing! You can feel happy when you've grown as a person!
The gold Special Medals are particularly sparkly! Life is special! Treasure every day, and don't pass a day the same way twice!
Summer's so far away. I want to see again the sight I saw that night.
Recently, you can see Stunfisk in this pond when the sun goes down!
Right now, the hot thing is Striaton City's Stunfisk nights! A huge school of them gathers. It's a sight that's hard to describe. You have to be careful not to step on them.
Unn unnn?!

I'm Chili! My Fire-type Pokémon and I are too hot to handle! What it boils down to is I want you to be my partner!
Yeeeeooow! I'm the strongest of us brothers, and I'll make sure you win!
Aww, man! I was all fired up, too!
That's that, then! I'm going to show you what me and my blazing Fire types can do!
I was good, too, but you aren't half bad! How about it, Cilan and Cress? Out of the three of us, I'm the strongest Trainer, right?!
Eeeooow! You're intense! Battling together with you got me all fired up, man! Come battle again sometime!
You look like you'd be fun to battle together with! All right! Team up with me tomorrow!
C'mon! What it boils down to is I want you to be my partner!
I'm a Water-type specialist, and my name is Cress. Pleased to make your acquaintance. You there. Would you be so kind as to be my partner in a battle with my siblings?
That's wonderful. With me, Cress, as your partner, victory is assured.
Oh, what's this? I'm amazed you turned me, Cress, down.
That is correct! It shall be I and my esteemed Water types that you must face in battle! Let us begin, then! En garde, user of Grass-type Pokémon-- Cilan--and of Fire-type Pokémon--Chili!
My attacks flow like water. You were blessed with an amazing partner.
Battling together with you helped me find new potential in myself. That's what I think. I'd like it if you were to team up with me tomorrow as well.
Losing made me realize something. If I were to team up with you, our onslaught would be like a torrent!
What do you think? Will you partner up with me and compete against my siblings?
Um. My name is Cilan. I like Grass-type Pokémon. We were Gym Leaders, but in order to improve ourselves further, we are working at this Restaurant and spending every day with Pokémon. How about it? Would you team up with me and take part in a Double Battle?
OK. If you're fine with me, I will put everything I have into being your partner in battle!
...Ah, hmm. I must've timed... my invitation poorly... True enough, I did want to... to have a Pokémon battle with you.
OK... So, um, I'm Cilan, I like Grass-type Pokémon, and this is my partner here!
OK... So, um, I'm Cilan, I like Grass-type Pokémon, and this was my partner here!
...What a surprise. You...are very strong. Would you team up with me again sometime? There's still much I want to learn.
During the battle I was so taken with your fighting style, I almost lost the timing for giving my Pokémon directions! Next time, I would like to team up with you.
How about it? Would you team up with me and take part in a Double Battle?
Hello! I'm giving out water!
Welcome! This is a lively restaurant where you can enjoy a show!
Will you come see Striaton Restaurant's famous VAR(257, 1) show?
OK! I'm going to get all fired up!
That's too bad... I guarantee it's great, though.
Ready all VAR(257, 1)! Everyone, gather up!
The VAR(257, 1) that I will have you follow today is...
This--the VAR(257, 1) that's absolutely raring to go! It's holding a VAR(265, 0)! Ready, set, go!
This--the VAR(257, 1) with the cute round eyes! It's holding a VAR(265, 0)! Ready, set, go!
This--the VAR(257, 1) with the pretty tail! It's holding a VAR(265, 0)! Ready, set, go!
OK! Find the VAR(257, 1) that I asked you to follow!
That VAR(257, 1) is holding a VAR(265, 0), right?
You are... ... totally correct! Receive your prize, a VAR(265, 0), from that VAR(257, 1)!
You are... ... inconceivably incorrect! I'm sorry...
That marks the grand finale of our VAR(257, 1) show! Thank you, one and all!
You want to see the VAR(257, 1) again? There are a lot of preparations and such to make, so come back tomorrow!
Waaatch!
Tch-hooog!
Oh? This show doesn't feature Patrat...
Striaton City's triplets make a fantastic combination! The user of Grass-type Pokémon, Cilan, can pick the finest leaves. The user of Water-type Pokémon, Cress, can bring the finest water. The user of Fire-type Pokémon, Chili, can heat water to the perfect temperature. Now I get it! They can make the perfect tea!
Hey! You've got the... Oh yeah... There's no Trio Badge now!
Let us tell you why the Trio Badge no longer exists!
The unobtainable Trio Badge... No! One day we will make the Trio Badge shine again!
I hope today is a special day for you.
A day that's important to me, Cress...
Part of my past I want to forget... No, I mustn't forget it.
Welcome to Striaton Restaurant! This place used to be a Pokémon Gym, but a lot happened...
Well, why don't I tell you what happened...
Because of that day, we can truly aim for the top!
Huh? Aren't you going to guess which VAR(257, 1) has the Big Mushroom?
I see... Well, come talk to me if you change your mind!

If I were a Gym Leader, I wouldn't have quit... I would've felt like it was a waste.
Catching lots of Pokémon? Having a lot of Pokémon makes looking at the Pokédex or the PC Box so much fun!
Oh, Shaymin! When it comes to Shaymin, Gracidea flowers are important! I have a lot of Gracidea flowers, so let me share one with you.
Since early times in Sinnoh, people made a bouquet of Gracidea flowers to give someone to show their feelings of appreciation. Isn't that interesting? By giving a Gracidea bouquet, you don't have to say a word and someone will know how grateful you are. Quite a delightful custom!

It must have taken a lot of resolve for Cilan, Chili, and Cress to resign as Gym Leaders and leave to go retrain themselves.
I hear some people have felt the presence of a mysterious Pokémon in the Dreamyard lately!
Latios? It was in the Dreamyard?! It must have appeared there because it sensed the dreams lingering there.

Whatever your age, you can have Pokémon battles if you have Pokémon by your side. If you use the Internet, there are many people to battle!
After many battles, you start to see more deeply and understand things. That's why I know exactly what my husband is thinking!

I've trained only Fire-type Pokémon, 'cause they're my favorites! They don't do well against Water-, Rock-, or Ground-type Pokémon and moves. But thinking about how to compensate for that is one of the fun things about being a Trainer.

'Scuse me! Got a minute? You look like you know a lot about Pokémon. Could you use your knowledge to help me out?
Hey, thanks! Here's what I'm wondering about. Usually, Ground-type moves can't hit a Pokémon with the Levitate Ability. But I'm sure there's some way to do it. I just can't for the life of me figure out how... I have several ideas, but I can't decide which one to try. That's why I want to get your opinion on the matter!
Oh... Well, can't be helped. If you change your mind, I'd still like to pick your brain...
First, I'd like some advice about items. I want to use Trick or Switcheroo to give an item to a Pokémon that has the Levitate Ability so I can hit it with Ground-type moves! After considering which item to give, I thought the Iron Ball might work. I'm not sure, though... What do you think? Is the Iron Ball a good idea?
Yes
Sure
Sounds Good
Oh! I knew it! Hearing you say it makes me feel much more confident! Passing the Iron Ball to a Pokémon with Levitate means Ground-type moves can hit it! Thanks!
I'd like to pick your brain again. Is that OK?
I'd like to get your advice on moves. If I use a certain move on a Pokémon with the Levitate Ability, and then use a Ground-type move on it, I think that could work. Which move should I choose: Smack Down, Gravity, or Gastro Acid?
Smack Down
Gravity
Gastro Acid
I see! Smack Down! That move will knock a Flying-type Pokémon or a Pokémon with Levitate out of the air, so Ground-type moves will work on it! So if I use Smack Down and then use a Ground-type move... I get it now! Thanks!
I see! Gravity! The move Gravity makes gravity stronger, so Ground-type moves will work on Pokémon with the Levitate Ability or Flying-type Pokémon. So if I use Gravity and then use a Ground-type move... I get it now! Thanks!
I see! Gastro Acid! That's right--Gastro Acid eliminates the effects of Abilities. That means Levitate won't work anymore! So if I use Gastro Acid and then use a Ground-type move... I get it now! Thanks!
Finally, I'd like a little advice about Abilities. Apparently, some Abilities will let you hit Pokémon that have Levitate with Ground-type moves! But... I'm not sure which one to use! Mold Breaker, Teravolt, and Turboblaze all seem like good choices... I'm close, but I can't decide. Hey! Please decide for me!
Mold Breaker
Teravolt
Turboblaze
So it's Mold Breaker, then? I guess that's right. Mold Breaker lets you use moves regardless of the target's Ability! Levitate won't matter, so you can land hit after hit with Ground-type moves! Mold Breaker's so cool! Viva Mold Breaker!
So it's Teravolt, then?! I guess that's right. Teravolt lets you use moves regardless of the target's Ability! Levitate won't matter, so you can land hit after hit with Ground-type moves! Teravolt's so cool! Viva Teravolt!
So it's Turboblaze, then?! I guess that's right. Turboblaze lets you use moves regardless of the target's Ability! Levitate won't matter, so you can land hit after hit with Ground-type moves! Turboblaze is so cool! Viva Turboblaze!
Thanks! Because of you, I'm prepared for Levitate! And I'm even more prepared for anti-Levitate tactics! Heh heh heh... Now, no matter which Pokémon I face, victory is assured for my levitating Pokémon!
Well! Do you dare battle my invincible Pokémon with Levitate?
Hmm... I thought I was completely prepared for anti-Levitate tactics... In real battles, things never go as well as you would think. Or maybe you're just that good!
If you want to battle, come talk to me again! I'll take you on anytime!
We increased the number of Trainers' Schools to meet the demands of Trainers who want to know more about Pokémon because they love them!
Pokémon have mysterious powers called Abilities. Some work even when the Pokémon is not in battle. For example, when a Pokémon with the Suction Cups or Sticky Hold Ability is at the front of your party, you're more likely to get a bite when fishing!
The Wide Lens and Zoom Lens are very similar. Here's the difference. The Wide Lens boosts accuracy by 10%! The Zoom Lens boosts accuracy by 20%, but only if the holder moves after the target. That means the Zoom Lens is best for slower Pokémon!
Would you like to take a simple quiz?
So here is the question: Which of the following Berries cures confusion?
Persim Berry
Aspear Berry
Pecha Berry
Ding ding ding! Right answer! Now for the next question.
OK! The move Swagger raises the target's Attack, but it also causes which status condition?
Asleep
Flinch
Confused
Ding ding ding! We have a winner! Fantastic answer! Here's a prize for you!
Here's a combo you can use in a Double Battle! Have one of your Pokémon hold a Persim Berry. Then, have the other one use Swagger on that Pokémon. Its Attack will go up, and the Berry will heal the confusion immediately. Then it can hit the opponent harder! There are many possible combinations in Double Battle!
Come talk to me if you want to take a quiz.
Buzzzzz! Too bad... That's incorrect. Please try again sometime!
The blackboard explains Pokémon status changes in battle.
What do you want to read about?
If poisoned, a Pokémon steadily loses HP when battling. The poison lingers after the battle. To cure it, use an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat and may prevent movement. It remains after battle, so use a Parlyz Heal.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to attack. The Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if a battle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep. Wake it up using an Awakening.
A burn reduces the Attack stat and steadily reduces the victim's HP. A burn lingers after battle. Cure a burn using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely helpless. The Pokémon may thaw out on its own, but if a battle ends while it is frozen, it will stay frozen. Thaw it out using an Ice Heal.

Kyouuuun!
Uxie went flying off somewhere...
These old textile storehouses are being reused as studios. How innovative! New ideas create new values, don't they!
Hey, Trainer! Step inside for a moment!
You see, I believed it would become popular because it was a storehouse!
The rail line was abandoned, and the storehouses went unused... Then young people with artistic aspirations started renting them cheaply as art studios. If people hadn't been so creative, Pokémon might be living here now.
My accordion's heavy! It weighs over 20 pounds.
What do you call a storehouse you can't find? A where-house!
How many houses could a warehouse wear if a warehouse could wear houses?

Welcome to the Nacrene Museum!
Currently, we're exhibiting a replica of the Dark Stone, which was a legendary Pokémon's dormant form.
Currently, we're exhibiting a replica of the Light Stone, which was a legendary Pokémon's dormant form.
Wow! Whenever I look at this skeleton, I'm...fascinated.
Welcome! I'm Hawes, the assistant director. Since you were kind enough to visit, I'll give you a tour of the museum.
???: Why, you're VAR(256, 0), right? You came all the way out here! Well now, which do you like better-- the Cover Fossil or the Plume Fossil?
Cover Fossil

Do you really want to choose the Cover Fossil?
Do you really want to choose the Plume Fossil?
Which do you like better, the Cover Fossil or the Plume Fossil?
Oh, come now! Don't be shy! You're too young to be bashful!
The Cover Fossil! Now, that's a nice choice! If you want to restore it, go to our reception counter!
The Plume Fossil! Now, that's a nice choice! If you want to restore it, go to our reception counter!
Hawes: Dear! Suddenly interrupting my tours will surprise the patrons. Oh, and you haven't even introduced yourself yet, have you?
Oh, that's right. I'm Lenora, the director of this museum! I'm always in my study, so come visit if you have time!
Oh, that's right. I'm Lenora, the director of this museum! I'm always in my study, so if you want a Fossil, drop by and say hello!
Hawes: Oh, dear... Well, let's continue our tour. This skeleton is of a Dragon-type Pokémon. There's a theory that it had an accident while it was flying around the world, and so it became a Fossil.
We learned that Deoxys changes its Forme by coming into contact with the power of meteors.
Oh! Now, this is a truly interesting artifact! This is a replica of that Dark Stone! Have you heard of the Dark Stone? This is the form of the legendary Pokémon Zekrom while it rests... What? You've seen Zekrom? That's amazing! In that case, my explanation is superfluous, isn't it?
Oh! Now, this is a truly interesting artifact! This is a replica of that Light Stone! Have you heard of the Light Stone? This is the form of the legendary Pokémon Reshiram while it rests... What? You've seen Reshiram? That's amazing! In that case, my explanation is superfluous, isn't it?
The library is in the next room. Beyond that is the director's room. By the way, Lenora is a former Gym Leader!
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious... From the outside, you can't see their functional, efficient design. It's almost as if it is an embodiment of their former essence... So fascinating!
Rarities from around the world... Museums are packed with adventure!
I heard that the director, Lenora, is too busy with her research on Fossils and Pokémon bones, so she took a break from being a Gym Leader.
Perhaps there is a Pokémon that came from space along with this meteorite.
The Thick Club held by Marowak... Just like how Cubone wears its mother's skull, Marowak could also battle with the bone of someone dear to it...
You! Bones can talk!
You seem all right, but it's natural for people to have different opinions. Don't fight over it--enjoy it. Consider why they might think like that!
This is a skeletal specimen from a Pokémon that flew around the world.
It's a Fossil of a Pokémon that was protected by a very hard shell.
A meteor that has a space virus attached to it.
                       
Special Exhibition! This is a replica of the Dark Stone-- the legendary Pokémon Zekrom's dormant state.
Special Exhibition! This is a replica of the Light Stone-- the legendary Pokémon Reshiram's dormant state.

Bones that were once carried as weapons by a certain kind of Pokémon.

This book collects research on Pokémon bones and fossils. Not only can we learn about ancient Pokémon's bodies from bones and fossils, we can learn about how people of ancient times interacted with Pokémon. To ancient people, Pokémon were a sacred presence. They were revered to a much greater extent than happens today.
This book introduces the various Pokémon that help out in the world of work. For a potter to fire plates and pots in a kiln, the temperature must reach 600° F. This is where Pansear can help! It increases the temperature in its prized tuft and fires the pottery!
This book is about how much the Unova region has changed in two years. Each year, many people move to Unova, so the environment and cities change at a dizzying pace.
This book is about the things you can ride in the Unova region, such as Castelia City's cruise ship and Mistralton City's planes. Before there were planes, locomotives carried people all over Unova. The railway in Nacrene City is a legacy of those lines.
This is a book a Backpacker wrote about visiting the Unova region's five famous bridges. There are around 200 pages dedicated to the charms of drinking Lemonade and watching the cruise ship from the Skyarrow Bridge at sunset.
This is a magazine about the gourmet foods in the Unova region. People in the know start out with Moomoo Milk and a Village Sandwich. Then, to finish off the meal, a classic favorite, a Casteliacone!
                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                  
This is a story about a kind but cowardly Lillipup. In order to save its sick grandmother, it goes in search of medicine in a cave where a scary ghost lives. This volume tells the story of how the crybaby Lillipup summons the courage to set off on its journey.
This is the story of a cowardly Lillipup and a short-tempered Zorua. A violent Zorua blocks the path of Lillipup, who is headed to a cave to get medicine. After this, that, and the other thing, the two of them become friends and decide to travel together.
This is the story of a cowardly Lillipup, a short-tempered Zorua, and a lonely Yamask. When Lillipup and Zorua enter the cave, they hear a creepy cry! Sticking close to each other, deep into the cave they go. They find a Yamask loudly crying. It wanted very much to make friends, but everyone was scared of it, and nobody would be its friend. After this, that, and the other, they figure this out, and the three new friends continue into the cave.
This is a story about three pals, Lillipup, Zorua, and Yamask. After fleeing from a colony of Woobat and working together to defeat a Krokorok that was being a bully, they find the medicinal herb Lillipup needs. The three of them make a pinky promise to play together again, and each returns home, although they want to play more. Lillipup gives the medicinal herb to its grandmother, and she feels better! Yay! From then on, the three Pokémon became the best of friends forever, and everyone lived happily ever after!
I'll read to you from my favorite book-- “The Mythology of the Sinnoh Region." Long ago, when Sinnoh had just been formed, Pokémon and humans led separate lives. That is not to say they did not help one another. Indeed, they did. They supplied one another with necessary items, and they supported one another. One Pokémon said to the others that they should always be ready to help humans. It proposed that Pokémon be ready to appear before humans whenever needed. Thus, to this day, Pokémon appear to humans if they venture into tall grass.
This library used to be a Pokémon Gym!

You and VAR(257, 0) can become an even more wonderful team!
It's a little bit friendly to you... Something like that.
Hmmm... It may still take some time.
Are you just letting it get knocked out in Pokémon battles?!
What's this? Are you a disciplinarian? Or do you plan to use the move Frustration?

Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Skill Swap! Skill Swap switches your Ability with the target's! Not only can you make an advantageous Ability your own, you can dump a harmful Ability onto your opponent! There are some Abilities that you can't swap, but be good to it even if it fails!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than After You! After You makes the selected Pokémon use its move right after After You is used! It doesn't work in Single Battles or Rotation Battles. But Pokémon using it can make a slow ally move faster, or you can throw off your opponent's timing! This is a great technique for catching an opponent off guard!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Magic Room! Magic Room makes it so items held by Pokémon have no effect for five turns after it's used! You can stop the effects of items that help your opponent. Plus, you can get rid of held-item effects that hurt your team! Even better, it interferes with moves like Fling and Natural Gift!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Wonder Room! Wonder Room swaps the Defense and Sp. Defense of all Pokémon for five turns after it's used! The best choices for attack and defense change completely, depending on whether physical moves or special moves are effective. This move has a monumental effect on battles!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Sleep Talk! Sleep Talk can only be used by a Pokémon that's asleep! The Pokémon using Sleep Talk randomly uses any other move that it knows! With this move, you don't have to worry about not being able to use moves when asleep!
Dire Hit? In Unova, it's called Dire Hit. Huh? No difference?

Thank you! I'll let you hang on to it. Every day, we get a lot of different customers, so all ya gotta do is ask 'em!
Sniff... I sure want to give this forgotten handkerchief back to its owner...
I think it might have been the customer who had a brown Pokémon that can use Super Fang...
What? You found the customer who lost his handkerchief?! It was the person with Patrat, you say? What a relief. Thank you so much! Here, this is for you!
Work is so much fun! I mean, I get to meet so many people and Pokémon!
It's Monday! I'm drinking a Moomoo Milk to get myself stoked up for the week! It makes me feel like Krokorok and I are both ready to take on another week!
Hm? Did I lose something? No, I don't think so... I bet it was a customer on another day.
I always come here to relax with Lillipup and look at lovely Fossils in the museum. By the way, my little Lillipup's specialty is Roar.
What? No, I haven't lost anything. My sweet Lillipup can't use Super Fang, either. Perhaps it was another customer. Many people come to this café only on a certain day.
Don't you think my Munna would be a superstar if it was in a Pokémon Musical? It's on the path to success, just like me and my career as a Pokémon Trainer!
You're looking for someone who lost something? Aren't you nice? Munna isn't brown, though, so it must be a different customer. I think I might have seen someone with a brown Pokémon on Thursday...
I always come to Café Warehouse to relax after Patrat and I go for a jog in Pinwheel Forest. Getting a refreshing drink after exercising is just the best! Right?

Wa ha ha! My Watchog has nice fur! Doesn't it look impressive? I always come here to Café Warehouse every week and brag myself silly about it! Its Super Fang is super cool!
I haven't lost anything. Watchog doesn't let anything get by it! I'm sure whatever it is belongs to some other customer.
Taking it easy in the café on weekends makes me forget the stress of workdays.
My! That handkerchief looks just like mine, but it belongs to someone else. It does have a certain, hmm, ah, je ne sais quoi about it. What's with that look? OK. OK. It smells like a Patrat.

Ooh! The Insect Badge suits you even better than I thought it would! If you have three Badges, Pokémon up to Lv. 40 will obey you, including traded Pokémon. And, uh, you know what, I'll also give you this.
Struggle Bug also lowers the Sp. Atk of the target that was damaged. I'm the best guy to tell you this. It's the little things that count!
How many discoveries have you made since you started your adventure? When I was a kid, my innocent heart was captured by the beauty of Bug-type Pokémon. I drew with them and battled with them, and after all this time, I continue to discover new things. A world shared with Pokémon is a world swarming with mysteries.

I've got some advice for you! If you want to become strong, battle lots of Trainers and know your Pokémon well!
The Funfest Mission “VAR(320, 0)" has been added to the Entralink!
If you keep on battling, you'll get stronger someday!

If you're looking for the Gym Leader, Burgh, he said there might be trouble and then he took off! You can go look for him if you'd like!
???: Huh? Burgh vanished again?
Clyde: Oh! Hello, Iris. Something came up, and Burgh isn't here right now.
Iris: Hmm... Isn't Burgh always vanishing, though? He always says he's got artist's block and just goes wandering out of the Gym.
Hi there! Who are you? ... Looking for Team Plasma? But Team Plasma disbanded two years ago! I guess that doesn't matter! You're having problems, so I'll help you out!
Hmm... Now where would suspicious people go to hide?
That's it! That might be where they are!
Clyde: Good grief... Burgh and Iris are so similar. It looks like she went around the corner, toward the Pokémon Center. Do you know where the Pokémon Center is? If you keep following the street that goes around Castelia City, it's right there!
When it comes to loving my Pokémon, I won't lose to anybody! I hope that gets through to my Pokémon...
I've got plenty of Potions! With them, I'll bet I can beat the Gym Leader!
Wanting to become stronger as a Pokémon Trainer is good! You can have a good time playing with Pokémon or put them to work instead!
If I only had five Badges, I could buy Ultra Balls...
My little Palpitoad is utterly charming! When I come home tired, it makes me feel better!

Hmm? There's a shop that sells ice cream here? Is it good?

Boy oh boy! If the Champion buys them, too, these have to be cool!

My daughter asked me to get them for her, but look at this line!
Huh? Oh, here you can buy the dessert that everyone in Castelia City is talking about! Are you going to get in line?
The line gets reeeally long! But, it's worth lining up!
Yeah... This line is way too long. But, just between you and me, I hear the Champion loves them, too!

The ticket is $1,000. Would you like to get on board?
The ship goes under a big bridge called the Skyarrow Bridge in the Unova region, then turns around at Marvelous Bridge and returns to Castelia City. When the whistle blows five times, it means we've arrived at the dock.
From the deck of the world-famous Royal Unova, you can enjoy a spectacular view. And the passenger cabins are full of Trainers who love to battle. Please enjoy both the view and the battles! Note that as C-Gears may affect radio signals or instruments in the ship, we ask that you refrain from using them. Thank you.
The power of the C-Gear will be turned off. Is that OK?
We are leaving the port shortly. Bon voyage!
Certainly. Please come back again.

Uh, thanks... But you don't need to lie just so I won't be disappointed!
Augh! Those dirty Pokémon thieves!
That means the only place I still haven't checked is... VAR(256, 0)! Help me out!
Iris: Yep! The sewers are a perfect place for hiding!
Iris: Your friend... He seemed pretty mad. Did everything go OK in the sewers?
So what are you going to do now? You ran into Gym Leader Burgh in the sewers, didn't you? Maybe you should go to the Pokémon Gym and see how far you've come! I'm sure battling will help your Pokémon come to understand you better as a Trainer, too!
Some Trainers even toughen up their Pokémon in the sewers...
What? You want to go into the sewers? Well, OK... But watch out for wild Pokémon.
Because of the tide, you sometimes might not be able to get into the Castelia Sewers. It depends on the season.

If you don't mind, will you show me your feeling of gratitude again?
Thanks!
Well, OK. See you again soon! Don't forget a feeling of gratitude!
What a wonderful phrase! It warms my heart. If somebody helps you, show your feelings of gratitude. I am sure they will appreciate your feelings.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? If you complete several survey requests, you can advance in rank! If you advance in rank, people will look up to you, and you can get something good!
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are a B-rank statistician. You advanced to the B rank! You've been working hard. If you advance in rank, you'll get more new requests, so you might want to talk to the leader.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are an A-rank statistician. You're already in the A rank. That's awesome! I also have to work hard and take surveys. I heard requests for the A rank were difficult. Keep up the good work!
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are an S-rank statistician. You are close to the S+ rank, which is the best! I will support you! Good luck.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are an S+ rank statistician! Wow! I will also do my best to advance in rank as much as possible!
If you want to check your information, look at the graph on the back wall. Information about all the statisticians is kept there. Of course, we checked the information about you!
Have you answered a questionnaire? You should at least answer about what kind of person you are.
Are you having a hard time getting new survey items in the Survey Radar? If you want more survey items, answer questionnaires in the headquarters.
If you are an S-rank statistician, you must have answered all the questionnaires. What you want to know is what everybody wants to know. Please volunteer to answer questionnaires.
Good work today, VAR(256, 1)! We have more statisticians, and this place has become quite lively. The way things are going, we can collect more survey data.
The more I conduct surveys, the more fun it will be. I'm determined to pass by more people! It's way more fun to conduct surveys with people than doing them by myself.
By any chance, are you having trouble? If it's difficult to pass by many people, I recommend you try a timed survey. It takes time, but if you pass by just one person, you can complete the request.
I'll give you a hint. If you go to a place full of people, I recommend a head-count survey. You can collect survey data really fast, so you can complete the request in a short time.
Good work today, VAR(256, 1)! You've become the top statistician instantly. I should learn a lot from you and work hard!
When I answered a questionnaire earlier, I got a questionnaire sheet. Maybe I will answer all the questionnaires...
After the questionnaire, the next step is conducting a survey. Set the request you want to survey on the Survey Radar... And let's go!
New statisticians are not answering questionnaires. If they answered questionnaires, they could conduct more surveys... What a shame!
Hello, VAR(256, 1)! I've also started teaching novice statisticians how to conduct surveys.
What is the popular movie now? VAR(256, 1), do you have any idea?
What is the popular game now? VAR(256, 1), do you have any idea?
What is the popular... Oh, VAR(256, 1). I knew it. I have to take a survey by myself... Ah, it is a pain in the neck...
The survey requests from the leader are hard. Don't you agree? Besides, the number of more difficult surveys are increasing...
Hello! Good work today, VAR(256, 1). Have you finished all the survey requests from the leader? I heard if you finish all the requests, you can get something good!
Oh! VAR(256, 1)! I'm honored to see you! Oh, wow! VAR(256, 1) spoke to me!
When you're happy, what do you say? I say “Awesome!" Could you teach me a new phrase?
Tell me something you just blurt out when you're happy!
Awesome!
OK, then. See you next time. When you're happy, you have to express that joy, right?
What a wonderful phrase! I registered it so I can input it quickly in my Tag Log comments!

Please show me a Pokémon that's VAR(259, 0) type!
Oh! You have that type! I'm inspired! Thank you! As a token of my gratitude, which one would you like?
Cheri Berry
Chesto Berry
Pecha Berry
Rawst Berry
Aspear Berry
One VAR(265, 0)! It's all yours now!
Aww. You are the best! Please come back tomorrow, too!
As long as the artist enjoys creating an artwork, it doesn't matter if the result is judged as bad or good.
If you catch a Pokémon that's VAR(259, 0) type, please show it to me! I'll give you a little something.
The Pokémon you chose is not the one I requested. What I want to paint is a Pokémon that's VAR(259, 0) type!
Oh! The shape of this Egg... Superb! It gives me chills! It's electrifying! It makes me tremble! Alas, even I cannot tell what type an Egg is!

People who work in this building have Pokémon battles, not opinion battles. You appear to be strong, but if you go upstairs, please be extra careful.
Oh, yes! If you'd like, you should have your Pokémon hold this!
That's the Exp. Share! A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share gets some of the Exp. Points from every battle, even if it's not involved. It may be useful for raising weak Pokémon!
I am a janitorial man. ♪ I make everything spick and span. ♪
Welcome! If you use the elevator, please use the buttons on the door or next to the door.
Every morning, my Pokémon wakes me with Uproar, so I always look like a wreck. But I appreciate its good intentions. I'll work my hardest to provide for it today, as always.
That thing you have is a Pokédex, isn't it? Wow! Coooooool! You collect Pokémon! OK! I'll help you. Which Pokémon did you choose at the beginning of your journey?
You have Snivy! Then I will give you this! When you have your Pokémon hold it, it can raise the power of Grass-type moves!
You have Oshawott! Then I will give you this! When you have your Pokémon hold it, it can raise the power of Water-type moves!
You have Tepig! Then I will give you this! When you have your Pokémon hold it, it can raise the power of Fire-type moves!
A lot of items have effects when Pokémon hold them, so be on the lookout for these items! Well, work hard to fill up your Pokédex! Good luck!
Snivy
Oshawott
Tepig
Quit
Do you have Snivy?
Do you have Oshawott?
Do you have Tepig?
Then, what is the Pokémon you chose at the beginning of your journey?
If you want to tell me, please speak to me!
I'm from the Castelia Harlequin Hunt! You found the Battle Company Harlequin! All riiight!
Battle Company develops many different items for Pokémon and Trainers!
This is Battle Company. Research and Development of Items!
Burgh's signature is scrawled in the corner of the painting.

===============================
Text File: 54
===============================
I am in charge of development! I'm going to give you this, because you came here for a company tour!
If a Pokémon holds a Scope Lens, it has a better chance to make a critical hit!
Oh! A company tour? Anyway, let's have a battle!
What power! I'm moved, so I'll give you this present!
A Quick Ball makes it easier to catch a Pokémon if you use it at the very beginning of a battle.
Did you come for Pokémon practice? I'll be happy to help you out!
With skills like that, you can get the most out of these!
A Timer Ball makes it easier to catch a Pokémon you've been battling for a long time!

Oh! You are the Pokémon Trainer I met at the entrance! You've come this far. That means you must be quite strong. Are you prepared to face the strongest person in this building? Then, the time has come to challenge my grandson, the company president!
I'll show you just how much this Battle Company has researched Pokémon and Trainers!
I lost... Because you were strong, and I was weak. We must do even more research for Pokémon and for Trainers!
Thinking that when you win it's because of your Pokémon and that when you lose it's because of yourself might make you stronger... But enjoying yourself is much, much more important!
If you want to make a weak Pokémon stronger, you should use that Exp. Share. Any Pokémon that holds it receives Exp. Points, even when it doesn't participate in battle!
My dream as president is to release a device that lets people talk to Pokémon!

Hi there! You're participating in the Medal Rally, aren't you? Let me have a look here. The number of Medals you have is... VAR(514, 0)!
I have 10! I'm ahead of you!
I have 30! You've collected many, but I'm not going to lose!
I have 50! Did you know? If you collect 50 Medals, something good happens.
Whoa! You reached the goal, too? Me? I have 100! Heh heh!
Amazing! You've collected that many? You have more than me! I've been having trouble getting more since I collected 100...
If anyone can collect every Medal, it's you! I don't know how many there are in all, but... Me? I only have 150... I'll do my best!
Wow! You collected every Medal?! A-amazing! That's too incredible! I finally collected 200! I'll use you as an inspiration, and I'll do my best to get every one!
The maniacs for items are sure odd! They'll buy ordinary items for much more than normal! If you hold on to items, even ones you have no use for, you might be able to sell them to a maniac!
My Roggenrola's Ability is Sturdy! If an attack that would knock it out hits it when its HP is full, it will stay standing with one HP!
Sturrr!

Hello! I am the Game Director. Ah! You are working on your Pokédex! If you fill it up a lot, please let me see!
Hello! I am the Game Director. Oh! You've caught every kind of Pokémon in Unova! It's truly amazing! Now, we'll give you an award!!
I will send this award certificate to your house!
Hello! I am the Game Director. Oh? By any chance, did you... obtain all the Pokémon and complete your Pokédex? Great. I am very happy that you made great efforts to obtain so many Pokémon. Please, please, please allow me to present you with this award!
The Pokédex. How did you obtain so many Pokémon? Obviously, you caught some by yourself, but you can't complete the Pokédex by just catching them, right? You probably traded Pokémon with your friends and people all over the world to complete it... If that's the case, the Pokédex is not only a wealth of Pokémon information but also a compilation of your communication with others.
I will send this award certificate to your house, too!
A game is something to think about, program, and, at the end, hope for! Work! Work! Work! Please work!
I am the Graphic Designer. To draw something I've never seen, I need to observe a lot of objects. Not only do I have to look at them, but also I need to analyze them and truly absorb them.
A tip for getting strong in Pokémon battles... Let me see. I guess the most important thing is... having a lot of battles! Do you want to battle?
Well, let's begin!
OK. I hope we can battle next time.
Oh! You've become strong! I can tell. Do you want to have a battle with me?
Well, let's begin!
You think about battles very thoroughly. I lost, but I learned a lot from you. Besides, it was fun! Come back again tomorrow.
No? I've been raising Pokémon, thinking about their Abilities and just the right combination of held items. What a pity...
I'm Snorlax. No, no. I'm the Planner! I don't mean to butt in, but the item Leftovers is important, isn't it? It's pretty useful in battle. Do you want to battle and test it?
I like to win using my favorite Pokémon!
Awww! What great Pokémon! The great number of steps seems to have increased their trust in you... I hope we can battle again tomorrow.
No?! Really? My Pokémon are pretty, though...
I'm the Sound Designer. I just woke up. I wonder what kind of music people like.
Hello! This is GAME FREAK.
Now, er, I'm, er... I'm thinking, er, a new plan of, er... ...Of a game.
This place is cold because we have to keep the server cool.

My friend worries about everyone's health when they set off on journeys, so he always nicknames Pokémon he trades “Gesundheit." I wonder how he's doing?
Gesundheit: ...Pan?
Mr. Lock... He was a mysterious man...
Traveling Trainer! Use this amulet to make sure you are always smiling!
When a Pokémon holding that item participates in battle, you get more Prize Money!

I want Pokémon to be in the new office... But I can't say such a thing in front of my girlfriend.
Even before Poké Balls were created, people and Pokémon were good friends. I wonder if this relationship will last in the future, too.
Missing Pokémon... Even if Team Plasma is responsible, we don't know where they are.
I learned some Pokémon want to be with Trainers... Of course, some Pokémon prefer to live wild. For your information, I heard Pokémon who have learned a hidden move may come back, even if you try to release them.
My Pokémon... Where did it go...?
My Pokémon! Scraggy came back! I don't know if it was held captive by Team Plasma... or it was lost and came back by itself... But anyway, I'm happy!

Bianca: Hey there!
When I saw you in the city, I just had to catch up with you! Here, take this! This is a Dowsing Machine!
You can use the Dowsing Machine to find places where items are hidden. It's exciting to find an item while you're looking for a Pokémon. Ooh, good luck!
Oh! If you often use the Dowsing Machine, the Habitat List, and so on, why don't you register them? Er... I think it's written in this book... I found it! OK. I'll read it. “You can use the registered item just by pressing the Y Button!" See? OK. Bye!

The number of Trainers on the Royal Unova today is VAR(512, 3). And you've won against VAR(512, 4). The ship is nearing the port. Would you like to get off the ship?
The number of Trainers on the Royal Unova today is VAR(512, 3). The ship is nearing the port. Would you like to get off the ship?
There are a lot of cabins in this big ship! I would like to give you advice 'cause you need help finding Trainers! Do you want to listen to my hint?
Some guests like to tell really long stories, and they just keep talking until they hear a whistle!
The Royal Unova's renowned observation deck is just ahead.
If you’re looking in the cabins with blue doors for someone to battle, you’ll find only one Trainer there today.
It seems the number of Trainers in the cabins with blue doors today is VAR(512, 2).
It's running on the ocean! What a peculiar thing to see!
I can't make up my mind whether to go to the observation deck or battle some Trainers in the cabins.
I'm running with the rhythm of the waves, but it's a real challenge!
Having battles on the ship and seeing the scenery from the deck... This ship is the best!
I've been wondering which cabin to enter this whole time!
I came here from Johto for business, but everything is dynamic here.
Oh! Nice timing! I wanted to talk to someone! I'm here from Johto on a business trip! Don't you feel like people here are a little cold? A little too suave, maybe? That's why I get nervous and have a hard time making friends. I mean, even today, it's my day off, and I'm here riding a ship all alone! That's it! Tell me how people make friends here in Unova! Please! Come on! You're busy? Couldn't you do something? Please! ... Ah, it's so nice to have a nice long conversation. Thanks!
Oh! A whistle is blowing! Sorry to bother you when you're busy! I hope you find some Trainers! I'll find some friends here by doing what you said!
Even on their days off, corporate warriors are ready for battle! Let's go!
No matter how many times we battle, I can't compete with you... I'll just relax and enjoy my boat ride!
You see, when going to a town on the coast, I always travel by cruise ship. You can take another look at places that you've walked and get a new perspective on them from the sea.
When I'm relaxing like this, I often remember the Pokémon I've raised up until this point. There were a few clumsy ones, but they were all the best group of Pokémon you could want!
I've been traveling all over because I wanted to prove Pokémon from the same place as me can make it anywhere in the world! I won't lose to you either!
Trainers like you are hanging out all over the world! Thinking about that gets me really pumped up!
I hear there are people on this ship from many places, like Kanto, Johto, and Sinnoh... Not only can you see pretty scenery from the ship, it looks like you can see some unusual Pokémon!
I was on the deck with my arms spread out and feeling like I was a Pokémon. Then the ship suddenly shook, and I thought I was going to fall! Sigh... I wish I had someone to save me right away at times like that.
Ta daaah! Good guess! Get ready for battle. Here I come!
I've been waiting for a Trainer to challenge me! I was really sick of waiting! Thanks for talking to me!
Hey! Doesn't this ship get you all excited?! I went completely wild while I was all wound up like this... Then they locked me up in this room... I won't cause any more trouble! Let me out of this room!
Pickin' a fight with me, huh? Heh! You don't know what you're getting yourself into! Huh? What? Where are my Poké Balls? Oh! I left them at home!
I feel sick... But I'm a Trainer! I'm not going to lose to seasickness! Let's battle!
Urrg! Sorry! Leave me alone for a minute...
Know what? I love this ship! I mean, it's royal!
Hey, get a load of this! Everyone's so mean! They're calling me selfish and saying I blabber too much! Even though I'm the quiet and kind and cute girl that everyone adores! Changing the subject, what kind of Pokémon do you like? Oh... Never mind. More importantly, isn't this outfit cute? I really like this brand... ... ... How rude! How dare you say I talk too much!
Oh! A whistle! I just talked a little, and now it's already this late!
So, I recently moved here to Unova! Hey, I've got some Pokémon you don't usually see around here! Let's have a battle!
Aren't my Pokémon cute? I want to catch lots of Pokémon here, too!
You want to battle? Oh for pity's sake, this is why Trainers are just a bunch of uncouth brutes... Do something other than battle for a change. How about you enjoy this elegant moment quietly?
I hear the Royal Unova has been sailing around Castelia City since before I was born!
Nice! I was bored, because Mommy and Daddy are on the deck! Let's battle!
I have to wonder about parents who would leave their child to go talk about love on the deck!
The wind's strong today, so I'm relaxing in my room. I'll have this lovely room all to myself until we return to port! ♪
The first whistle means “Hello, nice to meet you!" The second whistle means “The ocean's lovely today!" The third and fourth whistles mean “Are you enjoying your sea voyage?" The fifth whistle means “Thanks, and see you again!" Isn't it a nice feeling to think the ship talks like this?
You! You came to pick up cute little me? Tee hee hee! I'll be your opponent in an amazing Pokémon battle!
That's right... You're going to take Pokémon with you, not me!
From your standpoint, I'm a Trainer from beyond the sea, and from my standpoint, you're a Trainer from beyond the sea!
Oh! Welcome. Please sit down. I'll pour you some tea. Please, don't be bashful! A Gentleman must entertain guests who are kind enough to visit his room. Come now. Forget about battles for one moment. Would you like tea or coffee? Doesn't it have a lovely fragrance? ... That was a lot of fun. Come again!
That was a lot of fun. If you'd like to relax again sometime, please come again!
Oh! Welcome. Please sit down. I'll pour you some tea... Kidding! I'm a Trainer! I'll entertain you with Pokémon!
Nothing like a tea break after an intense Pokémon battle! Would you like to join me for a cup? Ah... Out of tea...
Are you looking for Pokémon Trainers? Sorry, I don't know where to find them. But the crew may know where they are.
As I left my body to the swaying of the sea, a rich poem sprung up from the depths of my soul. The title is, “Everything's Blue!" Let me read it to you! Oh, ocean! You're blue! Sky! You're blue, too! I talk a blue streak! I'm afraid that in a blue moon, that sunset will turn a baby blue! That's it! My next poem is, “Everything's Red!" OK! Here I go! ... Mmm! Isn't that a moving poem? Hee hee! Feel free to cry!
You're looking for a Trainer? I'm sorry I didn't notice! I was sure that you were wandering around looking for a wonderful poem!
Hee hee! Looking for a Trainer? I'm an old woman, but do you mind?
Battling on the ocean sure has charm, doesn't it?
I hear there is a troublesome guy somewhere in the cabins who just goes on and on. He's called the Seviper guy because he resembles a Pokémon.
Ho ho! You talked to me, didn't you? Once I've sunk my fangs into you, I never let go! Everyone on this cruise ship likens me to a Pokémon-- I'm the Seviper guy! I mean, c'mon. I'm so lonely! I want to talk to young people! Well now, first of all, listen to me complain about work... ... ...Huh? What was I going to talk about again?
I don't care how many times the whistle blew--I'm lonely! Don't leave me!
I'm sorry! This room is being cleaned... Oh my! You're a Trainer, aren't you? Hee hee! Why don't we have a quiet little Pokémon battle?
The fact I stopped working to battle is our secret, OK?
Today... As for people, we have VAR(512, 0) on the port side and VAR(512, 1) on the starboard side.
Today... The number of people on the starboard side is VAR(512, 1), and...none on the port side.
Today... The number of people on the port side is VAR(512, 0), and...none on the starboard side.
If you're so inclined, speak to me. I will give you a hint anytime.
Do you want to know a hint about looking for Trainers?
Certainly. Just a moment, please.
Certainly. Please continue to have a great time!
Won against every Trainer on the ship!
Thank you very much for sailing with us on the Royal Unova. The number of Trainers aboard the Royal Unova today is VAR(512, 3). Please enjoy the trip.
The number of Trainers aboard the Royal Unova today is VAR(512, 3). You... Congratulations! You've won against every Trainer on the ship! The ship is nearing the port. Would you like to get off the ship?

A beautiful melody makes people happy. A sad melody makes people sorrowful... That's the power of melodies...
The scent you brought me reminded me of a long-ago melody from the fringes of my sepia-toned memories. It was a song my mother loved... It makes me feel so nostalgic. Would you like to hear the melody?
My mother once told me of a Pokémon that played a melody and danced so lightly that it filled people's hearts with joy. Then sorrow darkened the entire world, and the Pokémon's melody was lost... At the same time, somewhere, some red shoes were lost...
When you came through the door, I remembered the melody! And the Pokémon that had forgotten how to dance began to step lightly once more! You are the inspiration. You are a mysterious child...
Let it sing the Relic Song. Aria Forme will become Pirouette Forme, and vice versa.

This is your first visit to this café. Am I correct? Please...
Give this to your dear Pokémon.
You came all the way here. Enjoy...
I've been letting my tired mind relax in this café this whole time...
Listen to him playing guitar... I went back to the home I'd left behind, and my mother cried tears of joy... That's mothers for you.
You can't change your family, but you can change how you interact with one another. Still, that said...
Thanks to you and Meloetta, memories of my birthplace... memories of when I was little... memories of singing together after we finished gathering Berries... All these memories came flooding back.
The Funfest Mission “VAR(320, 0)" has been added to the Entralink.
I'm going to have fun gathering Berries with the people living in the countryside and the Pokémon I've met here in Castelia City! Of course, I'll be humming Meloetta's tune while I gather them!

My Pokémon and I like to laugh! When either of us starts laughing, we both start laughing! Gwa ha ha!
Gahoohoo!
What do you like on TV? I like the lady and Watchy Watchog!
Once when I tried to catch a Pokémon, the Poké Ball only shook once!
Oh! That does happen sometimes! I've just been calling it a critical capture! The more Pokémon you catch, the more likely that phenomenon is! Apparently, when the Poké Ball only rocks once, it's easier to catch a Pokémon.

So, I'm a “curiosee"! Do you know what a “curiosee" is? It's a person who is curious about everything, who checks places with nothing there, and who talks to all sorts of people!
Are you getting enough sleep? If you don't rest, you won't feel better! Rest is important, so I'll give you this!
I have my Pokémon carry a Chesto Berry! When I do that, they rest, feel better, and wake right back up!
Whooon!

Hello! If you'd like, I will massage your Pokémon.
Oh, I see. Please see me if you change your mind.
All right! Let me get started.
Massage the Egg? It may be a bit too early for that.
There. All done! The massage has made your Pokémon much more friendly to you!

Will you show me your Medal Box? ... The number of Medals you've received: VAR(514, 0)! Your medalist rank is VAR(310, 1) Rank! The Medal Rally has just started!
Hi! Is there anything you want to ask me?
Medal Rally
Medal
Hint Medal
Medal Box
Favorite Medal
No thanks!
The Medal Rally is a competition to evaluate various activities of Trainers. Data and records are sent from Medal Rally participants' Medal Boxes and then evaluated by staff at the Medal Office. The details aren't important. Just enjoy your journey!
Medals are gifts from the Medal Office for rally participants. If you meet the requirements to receive Medals, you can get them from Mr. Medal at a Pokémon Center. For your information, there are five types of Medals: orange Adventure Medals, blue Battle Medals, pink Entertainment Medals, purple Challenge Medals, and yellow Special Medals. Also, the more difficult the Medals are to earn, the more decorative they become.
Hint Medals are gray Medals for you to see hints to obtain Medals. When you receive proper Medals, Mr. Medal will collect the Hint Medals that achieved their purpose. Even if you wanted to keep a lot of Hint Medals, they wouldn't fit in your Medal Box anyway.
A Medal Box is a box-shaped device for storing Medals. You can check the number of Medals, names of Medals, descriptions of Medals, dates you received them, and so on. Press START to change the shape of the box so that you can see a lot of Medals at once, or you can change the order of Medals. For your information, I'm the one who created the Medal Box!
A Favorite Medal is a Medal that is shown to the public in communication. You can recommend or brag about the Medal in the Tag Log or in the Union Room. To register your Favorite Medal, press the A Button after choosing a Medal in your Medal Box. Press the A Button again to cancel it.
Actually, I believed that you would be able to collect all the Medals. You lived up to my expectation! You're really great! I'm very moved. Thank you!
Actually, I believed that you would be able to reach the goal. I was right! I'll keep cheering for you. Good luck!
Actually, I've been secretly cheering for you. Of course, as a staff member at the Medal Office, I will judge fairly, though.
Top Medalist!
Cool!

I'm moved!

Hi there, Trainer! My name is Fennel. I'm researching Pokémon Trainers!
The VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0) is a vital part of that research! Let me explain the system for collecting Trainers' save files.
VAR(65280, 2)Game Sync VAR(65280, 0)is a system that retrieves the memories of sleeping Pokémon! That's right! We can collect save files of Trainers from all over the world!
What's more, we learned that if you use VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0) to make a Pokémon sleep, it will have dreams. Then, when you wake up that Pokémon, its dream becomes the reality in a space called the VAR(65280, 1)Entralink VAR(65280, 0)in the middle of the Unova region. Amazing, right?! If you like, please send your save file. My assistant can explain the details, so if you're interested, please talk to her.
Fennel: VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0) is amazing, right?! If you like, please send your save file. My assistant can explain the details, so if you're interested, please talk to her.
Fennel: Oh, thank you! You also sent your save file. I saw it while I was researching Trainers! VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0) is amazing, right?
Are you a Trainer? Do you use the PC at Pokémon Centers? I am Amanita. I maintain the Box system.
Oh! You have a Pal Pad, I see! You can register your friends in your Pal Pad. After you register, you can link with those friends over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to do all kinds of fun things! You can trade Pokémon, challenge your friends to a battle, and so on. Let me give you a quick how-to on registering your friends. You can either input your friend's code directly by using your Pal Pad... Or you can use the IR Connection feature of the C-Gear. Then, you can register your friend!
Amanita: Is there something you'd like to ask me?
Box
Battle Box
Pal Pad
Cancel
You can store up to 30 Pokémon you caught in one Box. At first, there are only eight Boxes, but as you store more Pokémon, the number of Boxes increases!
In the Battle Box, you can register one to six Pokémon that you often use in battles. When you battle using Infrared Connection, you can also battle with the Pokémon in the Battle Box! It's convenient because you don't have to move Pokémon around!
In order to register your friend in your Pal Pad... You can either input your friend's code directly by using your Pal Pad in the Key Item case... Or you can use the IR Connection feature of the C-Gear. Then, you can register your friend!
Catch a lot of Pokémon, and use the Boxes a lot!
Oh! How are the Boxes working? Hey, that's right! I have a bunch of Eevee! Would you take one for me?
This is an Eevee I received from my friend in the Kanto region!
VAR(256, 0) received an Eevee!
Would you like to give a nickname to this Eevee?
Oh! Your party is full! The PC Boxes were designed for situations just like this!
How disappointing. Well, if you change your mind, please come talk to me again!
Eevee is an amazing Pokémon that has many potential evolutions!
I'm working as Fennel's assistant.
Is there something you would like to know about researching dreams?
Game Sync
Pokémon Dreams
Cancel
Game Sync is a system to collect save files from Trainers all over the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection by making Pokémon sleep and retrieving their dreams. Touch the Online button on the C-Gear screen, and a button called VAR(65280, 1)Game Sync VAR(65280, 0)appears. Choose a Pokémon to tuck in, then you can send your save file through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. You should be able to make more Pokémon sleep as a result of the research.
Pokémon Dreams... If you use Game Sync to make a Pokémon sleep, it will have dreams. When you wake up the Pokémon with Game Sync, its dream becomes the reality in a space called the VAR(65280, 1)EntralinkVAR(65280, 0) in the middle of the Unova region...
C-Gear Help If you have trouble using it, touch the “?" icon on the C-Gear screen!
What is the Pokémon Storage System? The person who developed the Pokémon Storage System for the PC connection is Bill in the Kanto region.

I am a Pokémon fanatic. I am famous in Castelia, too! Oh, look! You have a Pokédex! How many Pokémon have you found so far? ... VAR(514, 0) Pokémon! If you have 40 Pokémon or more, I'll give you something good!
I am a Pokémon fanatic. I am famous in Castelia, too! Oh, look! You have a Pokédex! Well, how many Pokémon have you found so far? ... VAR(514, 0) Pokémon! This is quite a Pokédex! I am quite impressed, so I will give this to you!
Eviolite is great! Both Defense and Special Defense of the Pokémon who holds it will increase! However, it's a peculiar stone because it's only effective on Pokémon that can still evolve.
I've been thinking about starting a new business... But it's quite a chore.
Don't you think a service that teaches Pokémon moves would be successful? What? There are already people who do that?
What kinds of Abilities do your Pokémon have?
My Patrat's Ability is Run Away! It can always get away from wild Pokémon!
Squeak!
Hmmm! Fantastic! Excellent! Burgh's paintings are magnificent!

Welcome! Welcome to my party! Please enjoy conversations with everyone!
Ich habe mir nun ein Auto zugelegt! Damit ist die nächste Stadt auch ganz ohne Orden zum Greifen nah! Es sei denn, ich rassele durch meine Führerscheinprüfung... Um... I just bought a car! Now, even without the Gym Badge, it's a quick trip to the next city! Well, it will be after I get my license...
Hello. Have you tried a Casteliacone yet?
Hey, Trainer! Check out my moves! Have you gone to the next city yet? I learned this move at the Musical Theater over there. Pretty cool, isn't it?
Ohhhh! Your Pokémon are so charming! I want cute Pokémon, too, so I can use this!
This move makes your Pokémon unbearably charming! All Pokémon of the opposite gender will fall in love!
Did you see the outfit that the supermodel, Elesa, was wearing?
Whatever Elesa wears is beautiful. A stunning ensemble!
My boyfriend isn't good at getting out of bed in the morning... In fact, he's so slow getting out of bed that I asked his Pokémon to use Wake-Up Slap on him!
Ciao! Ti stai divertendo? Non sentirti in imbarazzo. Parla pure con chi vuoi. Umm... Hi there. Having a good time? You don't have to be shy. Feel free to talk to anyone.
It's hard to get up the morning after a fun day like today.
I've asked my Pokémon to use Sing instead of setting an alarm clock. But I cannot get up at all. I don't know why.
¡Es la primera vez que vengo aquí! ¡Pero este precioso paisaje hace que me sienta como en casa! ¡La próxima vez traeré a mis amigos! Oh, excuse me. Do you understand me now? This is the first time I've come here, and the scenery and the homey environment are wonderful! Next time, I'll bring my friends!

VAR(256, 1): You didn't do anything. Not to me, at least... But I can never forgive Pokémon thieves like you! Just to let you know... You're about to feel my rage!
Team Plasma: Yeesh... Trainers sure are unruly these days. Is that it? You're mistaking your Pokémon's strength for your own? I couldn't care less about a runt like you, but I don't like being messed with!

Team Plasma: You've got to be kidding! And I bullied it so much over the last two years to toughen it up, too!
Team Plasma: M-me, losing in an instant?! Who IS this guy?
Team Plasma: You've got some nerve for a little brat!
Team Plasma: Looks like I'm up next! Just to warn you, I show no mercy!
Team Plasma: If we keep going like this, it'll end up like it did two years ago!
Team Plasma: We give up! I can't believe we lost to two kids! Just because you're strong, I'll tell you this... We, Team Plasma, are searching for something... When we find it, that's when our secret weapon will be able to use its true power! Farewell!
VAR(256, 1): Five years ago... Team Plasma stole my little sister's Purrloin. It had been given to her as a present. I was only a little kid... I couldn't do anything... So... So that's why I have to get stronger!
Good work! I knew you had good instincts! Well then...

I heard that in Gear Station you can have Pokémon battles in the subway! So I came here to test my skills, and, what do you know... the Subway Bosses were here! Isn't that amazing? I mean, they're the strongest Trainers in Gear Station! And they said they'd battle if it's two on two! This is an a-MAZ-ing opportunity! Would you PLEASE battle with me?
Oh, I see! You aren't prepared right now! OK, I'll stop them for now, but let's battle together sometime!
You're prepared, right? Will you battle alongside me?
Thanks! Oh! The name's Rosa! Let's become the best partners ever and surpass the Subway Bosses!
So I'll have you challenge the Subway Bosses with me, then!
They were so tough, even when they were holding back for us! That's the Subway Bosses for you! I want to get even stronger and battle the Subway Bosses when they're giving it their all! Thanks, VAR(256, 0)! This is a token of my appreciation! Please take it!
When you have the Vs. Recorder, you can record your battles with your friends or battles on the Battle Subway! VAR(256, 0)! I had a really great time battling with you! I hope we can battle together again sometime! See you!

I'm Emmet. I'm a Subway Boss. I love Double Battles! And I love the combination of two Pokémon!
Ingo: Having a battle in a place like this is a little irregular, but this must've happened for a reason. Battling in a different place will let me see different scenery, and I might learn something, too. Now, Emmet, if you have something to add, please!
Emmet: Follow the rules and drive safely! We're headed for victory! All aboard!
Ingo: Bravo! The combination of you and your Pokémon is truly fantastic!
Emmet: I'm Emmet. While I may have lost to you... I had a good time! Let's play again sometime!
Ingo: Yes! Definitely! Next time, please ride the subway and battle with us there! Well then, we're off! All aboard!

Well... Now, you...you're an even more wonderful Trainer than I expected. Your sweet fighting style swept me off my feet! Take this!
VAR(256, 0) received the Bolt Badge from Elesa!
If you have four Badges, including this Bolt Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 50, including traded Pokémon, will obey you. Also, here's this move I like. Feel free to use it, um, if you want to.
Volt Switch lets the Pokémon switch with a different Pokémon after attacking. Of course, if you don't have another Pokémon in your party, you can't switch.
I want my relationship with my Pokémon to be less like sun and moon and more like two blazing suns! There'd be no limit to how bright we could shine!
What my Pokémon want to do and what I want to do... When they are the same... We have more than twice the energy to shine!
Wait! Please walk with us.
A shining example of a Trainer... Since that's what you are, you should be able to collect all the Gym Badges and reach the Pokémon League! Then, you and your Pokémon will shine even brighter!
Elesa: A model always has to make other people's dreams a reality without losing sight of herself. It's similar for Trainers and Pokémon. Trainers have to give everything they have to make their Pokémon feel like they can win, no matter the situation. When I realized that, modeling became that much more fun.
Welcome to the Nimbasa Gym! A stylish Pokémon battle and fashion show created by Pokémon and Trainers is starting now!
Isn't this Gym beautiful when it's lit up? The Pokémon also look beautiful in this lighting!
You and your Pokémon sparkle and shine!
Are you beautiful as a Trainer? Surprise me!
Ms. Elesa is strong and beautiful... Don't make the mistake of thinking she's the same as us.
Beauty isn't just about looks. Strength is a part of beauty, both for you and for Elesa.
The show is coming to its finale. Now, I'll see if you are worthy to stand on the same stage as Elesa!
Being able to see a match between a challenger and Elesa this close... That makes even us gleam with joy!
That was a beautiful Pokémon battle you and Elesa had! I was captivated by it! What an absolutely marvelous show!
What do you think? Surprised, right? This Gym is, speaking frankly, a glittering fashion show and a dazzling stage! Well, for now, I'll give you this!
In this Pokémon Gym, we'll have you proceed by defeating the Trainers waiting on the catwalk! By the way, Electric-type Pokémon don't do well against Ground-type moves... Oh! But Ground-type moves don't work against a Pokémon called Emolga, so please be careful!
Elesa uses sparkling, bright Electric-type attacks! But the combination of you and your Pokémon shone even brighter! Why, you're...you're... a supermodel! Well, no. You're just a really good Trainer with great Pokémon!

Looking good! Let's keep doing our best!

This is the end of the Wi-Fi Train line. When you want to return to Nimbasa City, please talk to me again. Please enjoy your time here.
The challenge was interrupted.
The selection was canceled.
Constant battles make me nervous. I'm taking a little rest here.
I'm going to save up Battle Points and get some items for my Pokémon to hold.
For each seven-win streak, the Trainers and Pokémon who challenge you become progressively tougher.
I've decided to use only cute Pokémon! Do you have any unique thing you're particular about?
OK! I'm all prepared! All aboard for a battle journey!
Phew...I'm worn out. These Trainers are tough. I wonder how far I'll get with my skills.
Have you heard of the Subway Bosses? They appear only to strong Trainers, and they challenge them to battles. They are the Battle Subway's bosses.
That last battle was tough... I should've traded in my BP for a better item.
If you have wooon, the trip goes ooon! Relying on Pokémon, this vagabooond!
About time to take it to the next level. Give it your best shot, too!
The Trainers here are really tough from the very start.
My 42nd straight win... Not too shabby, eh?
Can't believe I won 84 straight... Is this a dream or a hallucination?
You've got a 14-win streak! Pretty good! Not bad!
I hear the Super Train is endless! In other words, if you keep winning, you can keep going, on and on to wherever!
I can go a lot further! I can win a lot more!
The eyes of the Trainers here are very serious, or maybe you could say glinting.
Is this the best this officer can do...? The light from the passing trains seems way too bright.
The Subway Boss was a suspicious, strange fellow. I still don't believe he was giving it his all.
Challenging people is also part of my police training.
I can legally go as wild as I want! This place! It's paradise, isn't it?
My journey has just started! Neither of us can afford to lose!
Being alone on the station's platform somehow makes me feel a little sad. People leave on their journeys here, and it reminds me of those memories.
The Subway Boss was a piece of cake! Maybe I should cut loose on the Super Train next time!
The Trainers sure have become stronger. I'm feeling a little uneasy...
It looks like my Pokémon skill has reached its peak power. I couldn't let go of my dreams... I'll hang them on you, stranger, young Trainer. And this is proof. Please accept this, youngster...
I'm going to return to my home and quietly cheer myself up with art!
Oh ho ho ho... I've already done better than I did during my last challenge!
Battle between two excellent Trainers is very artistic.
For being called a Subway Boss, that Trainer sure wasn't as strong as “Boss" suggests. It was almost as if... As if they are simply gauging how strong we really are.
Well then! It's about time to get on the train!
Now just wait a minute, little Pokémon! I'll let you battle lots and lots soon!
Urk! I got motion sickness on the train...
You beat our boss, right? Not half bad, hey! And now, super Trainer, you've earned the qualification to take on the Super Train! The Trainers on the Super Train are really tough. If you want to know the essence of the Battle Subway, you should give it a try!
I'd rather have an exciting battle than slowly drive the train.
Where did you come from? And where are you going?
We Depot Agents are the protectors of peace and order in the station. We are verrry opposed to littering on the platform, shouting or playing instruments, loitering, or any activities that bother other people!
Just like how a machine needs fine-tuning, Pokémon need maintenance, too. It's a necessity. For example, rethinking the moves that a Pokémon knows.
No clumsy gimmicks... No unnecessary items... The only thing you can rely on is the strength of you and your Pokémon. This place is wonderful, isn't it?
Over 100 straight victories... If this is all due to your strength, you're even a match for the Champion.
The strength of the Trainers on the Super Train is beyond imagination!
I had a taste of it... The rush of battle... I shouldn't... It's too wild... But at this rate, I'm going to end up on the path of battlers...
Howdy! I'm a genius Pilot! Unova's finest! And I'm comin' in first here, too!
I've seen elite Trainers like me all over the place, but... Seems like the battles will be tough from here on.
Even for an elite Trainer such as myself, it's starting to get hard.
Hey, how are you doing? I'm still going strong!
I've a-done it--77 straight wins! That number has a lucky sound!
We've defeated over 300 Trainers...
My my, what a weak-looking Trainer... I think I would just get bored if I battled you... I'll give you this, so just get a little tougher, OK?
I'm only interested in strong opponents... If you get tougher, I wouldn't mind battling you.
Not many people left on the platform... Guess that shows how hard it is to keep winning on the Battle Subway.
... Huh? What? What do you want? I'm busy planning my tactics for my next battle. I don't mean to be rude, but I really need to concentrate. Would you mind not talking to me right now?
Ninety-one straight victories is nothing more than a natural result for me. My glorious record will just keep going up!
You... You have the same eyes as me. You love battling so much... No, it's not just that... Battling is your reason for living. You and I are the same type, aren't we? So...I'll give you this.
You're continuing your battle, right? That's because we are that type of person, aren't we...
I'm going to leave a rockin' record and turn into a big star!
Hey, how are you doing? I'm still going strong!
There's more to Pokémon than it seems. The world of Pokémon battling really gets deeper and deeper.
I found this when I was cleaning. You can have it if you'd like.
Oh, no need to thank me! After all, I just found it in the trash. I don't understand it. Recently, many folks have just been throwing away perfectly good things.
I may be a Janitor, but I have a lot of confidence in my abilities!
All right! Bring out your Poké Balls! Now is the time for a battle!
You like battles, too!
I can't believe a Veteran like me would get into trouble like that. Where in the world are the Trainers here training?
How are you doing, Trainer? Are you starting to get tired yet?
Mumble, mumble, mumble... In order to bring good fortune, I always think about my family before a battle.
I've been watching you battle. Nice technique and judgment... Not surprising, after a win streak like yours.
Not many people around. But each person who is still here has shown true strength.
Even a Veteran can lose to a Preschooler if they get careless. Pokémon battling requires that you always be on guard.
Just a little more to 50 straight wins! Suddenly, I'm all pumped up!
You have the face of someone who absolutely loves Pokémon battling. Even now, you're still completely hooked on battling. Amazing. Hee hee... You have a promising future!
You and I both have 91 straight wins! Which of us will reach a 100-win streak first?
Dawn and dusk behind my battles... The rocking train softly rattles... How many hours have now passed since we left Nimbasa in the past?
This is the end of the line... The trip sure ended quickly. I don't want to go home yet.
If you've made it this far, that means you've won 14 in a row. What a fluke! Fourteen is how old I am! Ha ha ha...
I'm going to let people know I'm still as active as ever!
It's the end of the line already... I guess that means my Pokémon battle journey is over for now.
Phew... This long journey is hard on this old body.
Hmm. You've got 28 straight wins, huh? This time, I want to keep going with this momentum.
You also beat the Subway Boss, right? Someday I want to battle you, too!
When my favorite Poké Ball begins to shake, I tremble with excitement! You're no ordinary Trainer, are you? Perhaps you are the Champion somewhere?
Winning battles feels good, but I've traveled quite far... I wonder if I can get back in time for work tomorrow...
I finally have a 49-battle win streak. If I can do this well at work, I wonder if I can get promoted...
Both you and I have won more than 100 straight battles! I may have too much time on my hands, but so do you. Take this to commemorate our meeting of two similar people!
It's a really precious Berry, but I don't know how to use it other than to eat it as a snack...
It's a subway map of the Unova region.
Communicating. Please stand by...

Hello! How do you do? I'm the owner of this theater. Pleasure to meet you!
Ooh! I must say that you seem like a phenomenal Trainer! What do we do here? We use Props to make your Pokémon fashionable and glamorous! Do you want to join in and play Dress Up? To get you started, here's a Prop Case!
This Prop Case lets you store Props for decorating your Pokémon! First off, you need to pick a Pokémon!
Aw, I'm sorry, but that Pokémon can't play Dress Up. Please choose a different Pokémon next time.
Hmm, I guess I get it! You are expressing your Pokémon's innate charm by choosing not to decorate it! Honestly, though, I think using Props would be better received in this musical.
Now, now. Don't be like that. Please reconsider and select a Pokémon!
Then... It's time to play Dress Up!
Wow! You have the talent! You did a fantastic job coordinating everything! Utterly charming!
If you have a Pokémon that can play Dress Up, you can participate in the Pokémon Musical! Would you please join us? The receptionist can explain everything. Let us say a brief farewell! I eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage!
       
We really want you to participate in the musical! I apologize in advance if any of our Props don't suit some kinds of Pokémon. Pokémon are individuals, after all!
Wait! Please, wait! You participated in a musical with your friends, right? I felt like you opened up new possibilities for musicals! That's why I feel impelled to give you this present! Please accept it!
I eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage again!
Your continued participation makes me a happy owner! You're attracting a lot of attention as an up-and-coming stylist. Of course, I'm watching you closely, as well. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
Ah, I eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage again! ...Actually, it feels like I've said this line before. Well, that's OK. Because I'm the owner!
Seeing your continued participation makes me a happy owner. Apparently, some audience members have been calling you a top stylist as of late! Best of all... How impressive am I for recognizing your talent? Please accept this as a token of my gratitude!
I hope you continue to enjoy the musical!
Happy birthday! I've got this festive Prop to give you! It's a cake from me, the owner! Of course, this is a Prop, so you should attach it to your Pokémon and not eat it. By the way, even if today isn't your birthday, I won't take it back! Why? Because I'm the owner!
I want to make Pokémon more glamorous than ever before, so I'm researching the styles others use when playing Dress Up.
Great work! I saw your Pokémon up there today! Overall, totally VAR(291, 0)! The VAR(291, 1) Prop was a great accent. I noticed that your VAR(291, 2) factor was a bit subdued today. OK! I'm not going to lose!
Gwah!
When you play Dress Up, matching the show you're performing in is im-por-tant! If it's a good match, you can win the hearts of the audience! You'll be sure to attract attention. If you're going to get on stage, it's a waste if you don't stand out!
Pokémon Props each have their own image: cool, cute, elegant, or quirky. Before you play Dress Up, take a moment to think about the image you prefer.
I'm not trying to brag, but we're rather rich. When you say rich people, you think musical. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
It is such a treat when Trainers have played Dress Up with their Pokémon with such charming results.
Your Pokémon are wonderful! I'm always watching them. I hope you can keep entertaining us with your performances.
I always make sure to watch the shows you participate in! Even from the perspective of a rich man like me, the Pokémon Musical is impressive! It's unparalleled entertainment!
There is a Musical Photo saved from last time!
You can hang Musical Photos from your previous shows here.
Know what? When there are cute Pokémon, my eyes are glued to the stage!
Originally, people performed in this Musical Theater. One time, a Pokémon wandered up on stage and started imitating the actors. Everybody thought it was sensational! Ta-daaa! The Pokémon Musical was born.
If you are active in the musical, people will become your fans and give you Props. I don't have any Props, so I'll give you this instead!
With the move Echoed Voice, the power is boosted more and more if it's used every turn. Having a group use it might work well!
Persistence is important, so keep participating in the musical, and keep using Echoed Voice! You'll make more fans in the musical, and you'll do more damage with Echoed Voice!
Musical Theater Props + Music + Dance = Moving Spectacle!
The seats are beyond this entrance, but I think you belong on the spectacular stage!
Hello! How do you do? I'm the owner of this theater. Pleasure to meet you!
Ooh! I must say that you seem like a phenomenal Trainer! What do we do here? We use Props to make your Pokémon fashionable and glamorous! Do you want to join in and play Dress Up? To get you started, here's a Prop Case!
Hmm... Have we met before? Never mind. I must be imagining things. I'm the owner of this theater. Pleasure to meet you!
Whoa! You have no ordinary aura. It resembles that of a superstar who attracts a lot of attention. By the way, do you know what Dress Up is?
That makes it easy! Here's a Prop Case for you.
In Dress Up, we use Props to make your Pokémon fashionable and glamorous! To get you started, here's a Prop Case!
You know what? I'll give you this Prop Case! It contains all the Props our superstar VAR(256, 0) used to have.
I hope you'll be the superstar of a new generation! It's time to play Dress Up!
Hmm... Your aura is definitely similar to that of the superstar who attracted a lot of attention. Here is a present for you! These are the same Props that VAR(256, 0) used to have.
I believe you'll find a good use for these Props! I hope you'll enjoy the musical!
VAR(256, 0) received a set of Props!
VAR(256, 0) received a VAR(265, 1) and a set of Props!
Are you sure? Please talk to me again if you want a set of Props that are the same as the ones VAR(256, 0) used!
Oh my! You already have all the Props the superstar used to have. I knew you were something!
There used to be a Trainer who performed wonderful shows. I was a big fan back then. I wonder if we'll ever see another superstar like that...
Oh, you seem a bit like VAR(256, 0)! I was a big fan a while ago. You still lack a certain charisma compared to VAR(256, 0), though.
Oh, you are as wonderful an entertainer as VAR(256, 0)! I'm a big fan of you now! Thank you for a wonderful show!
Oh, you! You remind me of...
Mmm, that takes me back!
Would you like a set of Props that are the same as the ones VAR(256, 0) used?
You can receive this set of Props only once. Do you want it?

Welcome to the musical! I'm very pleased with your participation! Participants for this musical are:
VAR(256, 3) will participate with VAR(257, 2)!
And the show you'll be performing is VAR(290, 0). That is a popular show among VAR(307, 1). Well, without further ado... Let's play Dress Up!
I guess everyone is ready. Let's go up on stage!
Good job! The Pokémon were in total sync! It was the best musical ever! I am the owner, but even I was greatly moved. Since it's the best musical ever seen, we have received many comments from the audience! There are comments for everyone, so let me give them to you in order!
Hmmm... Good job! It was a great musical! In fact, I've received comments for you from the audience! I am really pleased. I will give them to you in order!
Good job! It was quite an interesting musical! I've received comments for you from the audience! Well, I am so pleased. I will give them to you in order!
Good job! It was a musical with some very exciting moments! By the way, I received comments for you from the audience. I am quite pleased. I will give them to you in order.
VAR(256, 0)'s Dress Up performance was very VAR(291, 1)!
VAR(256, 0)'s Dress Up performance was very distinctive!
In this musical, it's not an overstatement to say that VAR(256, 0)'s Pokémon was the lead role.
The Pokémon used Props to convey such abundant expression, just as if they were actors!
Watching your Pokémon's sharp moves, I also felt VAR(291, 1)!
Your Pokémon played its role very well.
It looked like your Pokémon was making an effort to live up to your expectations. I will support your Pokémon on the side!
It was not highly noticeable... But I liked it! Keep it up!
Thank you very much for participating in the musical today! Please join another musical again! Have a great day!

Yeah! I am an Infielder! I hurt my hand, so I can't write an autograph! Sorry! Say, how did you sign your Trainer Card?
Bwa ha ha! I am a Striker! My hand got hurt, so I won't be able to sign any autographs! Regrets! What does your Trainer Card signature look like?

Athletes who score points, and athletes who support them... Determining their different roles is the key to building a team!
Football is a fun sport that is divided into offense and defense.
His... Those eyes... It looks like he's coming right at me!
The helmet and pads weigh 15 to 18 pounds!
I've trained and built up my muscles by tackling Pokémon! Nothing can move me!
OK! I will defend to the end with moves like Protect and Detect!
My favorite moves? ...Hmm. I'd say Tackle and Take Down.
Reading your opponent's attack and deciding your next move... Both Pokémon battles and football have the same thrill!
The appeal of football? Let me see... First, just watch a game without thinking about the rules!
I'll protect my team with my whole body to avoid our opponents' interference!
In football, the quarterback is the athlete who decides a strategy and carries it out. He's kind of like a Pokémon Trainer!
In football, you have to learn each and every formation by heart!
The ball used in football is oval-shaped and hard to throw, isn't it? But once you get the hang of it, you can throw it perfectly!
I am a greeeeeat secret weapon! The only problem is, I am so secret that I've never been in a game...
Yoo-hoo! Pass me the ball!

I have baseball, and I have Pokémon... How happy I am!
If you don't swing a bat, you can't hit a ball. If you don't do things, you won't fail... but you won't succeed, either.
I give 100 percent of my energy all the time! That is the only thing I can do.
What I brag about is my bat!

Everybody makes mistakes. But goalkeepers cannot afford a mistake, because they cannot score goals to make up for it. If one Pokémon on a team makes a mistake, however, the other Pokémon and their Trainer can cover for it!
If a Striker catches a teammate's eye, they understand each other. A Pokémon and its Trainer are the same. Don't you agree?
Really strong Trainers thoroughly do whatever they can do!
Soccer is beautiful and fun! Pokémon are also beautiful and fun!
Soccer with Pokémon is Pokémon soccer. The abbreviation is...Poker? No, wait, that's a fireplace tool. How about Poccer?
Throw a sound pass to a team member! After that, to receive a sound pass, you'll need to move swiftly.

I hear that some people's Pokémon were stolen by Team Plasma, and they still haven't been reunited.

Perhaps capable of being more connected. I hope you enjoy the changes.

To ride this roller coaster, the first step is to get in the car. Next comes the platform! There, you can change where the coaster is going! Sometimes you continue by riding the cars of opponents you defeat. That's how you aim for the back!

The Gym Leader, Clay, is currently in the middle of something. Please come back again later.
Team Plasma: C'mon! Let's have fun stealing Pokémon together, like we did before!
???: I can't. I've learned the hard way that stealing from others is wrong!
Team Plasma: Oh, come on! It's too late to start acting all goody-two-shoes now!
Team Plasma: People don't understand our just cause! Don't they call you a villain who was plotting world domination? Even though you quit Team Plasma, people are still really cold to you, right? So, you might as well just come steal Pokémon with us and take over the world! The people who are mean to you now will be groveling at your feet and saying how great you are!
Ex-Team Plasma: I can't... My lord N will be sad... I can't do that to him...
Team Plasma: N! Team Plasma's king... What a joke! He's nothing more than a traitor! He disappeared somewhere and abandoned us when we needed him!
Hey!
Start talking, you Team Plasma trash!
Team Plasma: Oww... You're gonna pay for that! Oh, yeah. Almost forgot... I'm not supposed to cause any trouble. I'll get you next time!
VAR(256, 1): You're not getting away!
Ex-Team Plasma: I'm OK! We were friends when we were both in Team Plasma... But two years ago, Team Plasma split into a group that follows Lord N, who just wants to save Pokémon, and a group that follows Ghetsis, who plans to take over the world. You can hear the rest of the story in our home. It's on that little hill next to the Pokémon Gym.
Ex-Team Plasma: Sir, that's the person I was talking about!
Over here! This way!
Rood: Oh! So you're interested in Team Plasma, are you?
Ex-Team Plasma: If you hear what we have to say, you might be able to understand us.
Rood: My guest. If you're going to come inside, I would like to see what kind of person you are, Trainer. That's right. In a Pokémon battle. Do you find this acceptable?
Rood: Let us begin!
Rood: Then, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave.
Rood: If you're going to come inside, I would like to see what kind of person you are, Trainer. That's right. In a Pokémon battle. Do you find this acceptable?
Ex-Team Plasma: I'm sorry... Sage Rood is only saying that in order to protect us.
Rood: I apologize for testing you. Being former members of Team Plasma, we must deal with a lot...
VAR(256, 1): He got away!
Rood: And that is? ... Your friend? He may join us.
VAR(256, 1): Challenging the Gym, huh? Nice! Keep getting stronger! Let me tell you, though, Clay's tough! Even if all you have to use against Ground types is Water-type Pokémon, you might still be in for a rough fight!
VAR(256, 1): You got a Gym Badge, too! I knew you could do it! You know... My partners are the reason I was able to get that Badge. But I'm sure there's more connecting us to each other than Poké Balls! If that's all there is, the stolen Purrloin's feelings will never be what they were!
Clay: Oh, so you two squirts know each other, huh? Ya both ain't bad, so I wanna show ya somethin'.
VAR(256, 1): Wait! I just remembered. Clay... Why? What's the reason? Why have you forgiven Team Plasma?
Clay: There's always room for folks to grow and change, ain't there? And, if ya only go after what ya think is right, ya might end up rejectin' all thoughts and opinions other than yer own. That's mighty dangerous.
VAR(256, 1): Hmph... Is that one of those compromises adults are supposed to make? Whatever! I'm gonna fight Team Plasma! Oh yeah, what were you wanting to show us?
Clay: Ya ever heard of the Pokémon World Tournament? Trainers from all over the world gather on up to see who's toughest! Well then, I'll be waitin' for you at the south end of town!
VAR(256, 1): A tournament to decide who's strongest, huh? Right on! It's time for some special training!
So how about this city's pride and joy, the drawbridge? We also call it the Charizard Bridge due to its elegant form!
The Elite Four of the Pokémon League are extremely tough! I hear you can't battle them unless you have eight Gym Badges!
When there's an item in your Bag you want to switch, just press SELECT and give it a new niche! ♪ Doesn't that jingle take you back?
A long time ago, Team Plasma stole my Pokémon... Well, they did give it back later!
Rokorroook!
I want to level up my dear Pokémon so they never have to feel the sting of defeat!
Whoooa, dude! If a Pokémon uses the move Surf, it can catch a wave!
Even though I used to look at the Cold Storage every day... I've already forgotten what it looked like...
A Pokémon of thunder and a Pokémon of wind were roaming everywhere and causing trouble! Then they were punished by a Pokémon of the soil. I like that story!
On the other side of the ocean... And all over the world, there sure are a lot of different Pokémon!
There are former members of Team Plasma in there... I'm worried that they might be up to no good again...
Bridges connect different lands. Trading and battling with Pokémon can connect different people. I guess that means Pokémon are a kind of bridge as well!
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I wanted to get the attention of a girl I like, so I learned a new style of Pokémon battling. Its name... Rotation Battle! Want to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is really hard.
In Rotation Battles, you send out three Pokémon at a time and battle! One Pokémon takes the lead position, and the other two stand on each side. The trick is, each turn you can change their positions... And that's a rough explanation of Rotation Battles.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. Hey! If you're a Trainer, how about a Rotation Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you! I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I'm always at full throttle.
I hate to burst your bubble when you're all fired up, but... In Rotation Battles, you need three or more Pokémon to battle.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I have some advice for you. Challenge is the essence of life!
Sheesh. That's embarrassing. Getting schooled when I was planning to teach. Still, you have potential! You have to understand your Pokémon to win in a Rotation Battle. If you want more Rotation Battles, go to the Pokémon World Tournament!
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. Riding a bike and becoming the wind fits a bad boy like me.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I wanted to get the attention of a girl I like, so I learned a new style of Pokémon battling. Its name... Triple Battle! Want to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is really hard.
In Triple Battles, you send out three Pokémon at a time and battle! The rules are simple: just make all of your opponent's Pokémon faint. And that's a rough explanation of Triple Battles.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. Hey! If you're a Trainer, how about a Triple Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you! I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I'm always at full throttle.

Phew... You're really somethin'! Li'l whippersnapper Trainers who pack a real punch keep showin' up one after another. Mrmph. Here! Take this!
VAR(256, 0) received the Quake Badge from Clay!
So this is yer fifth Badge, huh? If that's so, Pokémon up to Lv. 60 will obey ya. Here! Take this, too!
I don't know how much potential ya got, but if ya think ya can go, go wherever, and if ya think ya can do somethin', keep doin' it. Do things how ya want! Decide yer own limits.
Well, I suppose... Come thisaway!
Clay: Mrrmph! You, huh? Remember what I done told ya? If ya think ya can go, go wherever, and if ya think ya can do somethin', keep doin' it. Do things how ya want! Decide yer own limits.
My Pokémon dig because they believe they're gonna find something, and they battle because they believe they're gonna win!
Clay's awesome! He can just tell if minerals will be there! Got it? Another way to say it is that Clay will be wherever there are oodles of ores!
The one you meet when you get on this conveyor is none other than me!
Have you used the elevator? If you get on the elevator, you can figure out where you haven't been, right?
Just because you work hard doesn't mean you're gonna get what you want! But if you don't work hard, there are many things you can't do. Let me show you how tough my hard work has made me!
Driftveil City's Pokémon Gym is soaked in the sweat and tears of the Pokémon that worked so hard to dig it out of the rock. So...well...it smells kinda funny!
Me and my Pokémon are professional tunnelers! My Pokémon can't be outdug or outburrowed! We have no rival!
Drilbur and Excadrill know the move Drill Run! When I order them to use that move, I get all wound up!
I have a riddle for you! Do you know what is distant but close?
Something distant but close... I'm talking about Clay, who is near here but is rather reserved. Sorry... I think you were expecting something more interesting!
Here in the darkness... I proceeded step by step while feeling my Pokémon's every breath! I'll show you the power of the bonds my Pokémon and I built in this way!
Isn't darkness great? It's the space of dreams where you don't know what's even there!
When I say dig, you say, “How low?"
Life is filled with pitfalls! If you fall in, do your best to crawl out!
Welcome to the Driftveil Gym! This is for you!
Gym Leader Clay uses Ground-type Pokémon! Well, just between you and me, Ground-type Pokémon aren't good against Water-type attacks. They also don't like Grass- or Ice-type attacks! Oh, and in this Gym, the area you walk on will light up. Where you've been is a hint for where you need to go!
Every now and again, I hope you look at the Quake Badge you won here and remember your battle with Clay!

Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Bug Bite! When Bug Bite hits a target, you can steal any Berry it's holding and use the effect for yourself! If the user steals an Oran Berry or a Sitrus Berry, the user will not only do damage, but it will heal itself as well! It's doubly effective!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Covet! When a Pokémon hits a target with Covet, it can steal the item the target is holding! If you steal a held item from a wild Pokémon, that item becomes yours when the battle ends!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Super Fang! Super Fang halves the target's HP! The user can do a consistent amount of damage even if it has low Attack or the target has high Defense!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Low Kick! The heavier the target, the more damage Low Kick does! It's a Fighting-type move, so it works well against Rock- and Steel-type Pokémon, which are often heavy!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Uproar! Uproar does damage for three turns after one use! A Pokémon that's in an uproar can't use any other moves, and no Pokémon in battle can sleep! Whether that's an advantage or disadvantage is up to you!

Ha hoo! You have a Pokédex. How many Pokémon have you found? Hoo ha! You've found 70 or more! Now we're talking! This is for you!
A Pokémon holding a Shell Bell recovers its HP a little bit if it inflicts damage during a battle. But what's more important is this. Have you shown the Pokédex to a professor?
Battling Pokémon stronger than you gives you more Exp. Points!

I am grateful that you came all this way! Are you a Trainer? Ooh, you have a Pokédex! It's so marvelous! I wonder if you'd please do me a favor.
Oh, Trainer. I'm so pleased that you came all the way here! I'm wondering if you would do me a favor today, too.
                                                               
I would like to see a Pokémon that learned a move called VAR(263, 0). To be clear, that's VAR(263, 0). Please show it to me today. Oh, my, my, my! Your VAR(257, 1) can use VAR(263, 0)! Did you go to the trouble of teaching it to your Pokémon? Marvelous! This is a small token of my appreciation. Please don't hesitate to accept this.
I'm touched that you came all the way here, yet you are being so unkind.
To be clear, I would like to see a Pokémon that knows VAR(263, 0). Thank you.
Oh, my goodness. Your VAR(257, 1) can use VAR(263, 0)! You went to all the trouble of teaching it to your Pokémon? That's so touching! This is a small token of my appreciation. Please don't hesitate to accept this.
I wonder what VAR(263, 0) looks like when it is actually used. I am sure you can use it skillfully!
Different kinds of Pokémon can learn different kinds of moves.

Getting to know someone creates both joy and sorrow. Puns that were funny when you first met get old when you hear them all the time.
As the Gym Leader of Nimbasa City, Elesa has a shockingly packed schedule. That's what you'd expect from an electrifying model!
Three years ago, Team Plasma talked me into letting my dear Pokémon go. Ever since, I've been staying in hotels as I please. ...To be honest, I feel lonely, but it's a good thing not to have Pokémon who'll be left behind and feel sad after I pass away...

Let me introduce myself again. My name is Rood.
VAR(256, 1): You guys are all Team Plasma too, right? Tell me, what makes you different from the Team Plasma back there?!
Rood: More accurately, we're former members of Team Plasma. Because of the incident two years ago, we started taking care of the Pokémon that were separated from their Trainers as a way to atone for our misdeeds. And you are?
I'm VAR(256, 1). From Aspertia City... Five years ago, Team Plasma--I mean you--stole my little sister's Pokémon. I'm the pathetic Trainer who wasn't able to stop you. “Separated?" What a joke! YOU were the thieves who STOLE them!
Rood: Is that so... My sincerest apologies...
VAR(256, 1): Just an apology? That's it?!
Where's my sister's Pokémon?! Purrloin! WHERE'S PURRLOIN?
Rood: The Pokémon you speak of is not in this place. I imagine it is still being used by Team Plasma now. Just as you say, our apologizing doesn't solve anything. But you can't move forward unless you admit you were wrong and apologize...
VAR(256, 1): Enough already! Apologizing isn't going to get my sister's Pokémon back!
VAR(256, 0)! I'm going to the Pokémon Gym! I'll get stronger and crush every single member of Team Plasma!
Rood: Team Plasma made Trainers like him suffer... I feel terrible about it... How foolish we were...
VAR(256, 0), as you can see, I can't do anything to thank you. Actually, I have a favor to ask of you. Could you please look after this Pokémon, Zorua?
Rood: Could you please look after this Pokémon, Zorua?
Rood: Oh! Thank you!
Rood: Oh! Thank you! ...But what's this? It seems you can't take any more Pokémon with you.
Rood: If you change your mind, please come speak to me again.
This Zorua was one of my lord N's friends, and it supported him. In the Unova region, there are many other Pokémon that helped my lord N besides this Zorua.
That Zorua is one of the Pokémon that my lord N relied on as a friend during his journey.
My lord N is a wonderful person who has the power to understand the hearts of Pokémon. But still, he has much to learn about understanding the hearts of people... I hope he will develop this skill while he travels with the legendary Pokémon to atone for the trouble he caused in Unova as the king of Team Plasma.
Team Plasma is an organization created by a man named Ghetsis to help him take over the Unova region. The one he groomed to help him further his nefarious aims was N. N was a strange boy who was called the child of the Pokémon.
I wonder if N understands now. Trainers battle with Pokémon not to hurt them, but so Trainers and Pokémon can understand one another better! It's the simplest way for them to do this. The more serious the battle, the more the true nature of Pokémon and people becomes apparent!
N was an orphan. I heard that right after he was born, he upset people with behavior that suggested he could talk to Pokémon. When he was living in the woods with Darmanitan and Zorua, Ghetsis took him in. We are also orphans Ghetsis took in. Our task was to take care of N.
I don't understand N's pure and innocent feelings. But I will be very happy if he figured out what he wants to do on his own during his travels with the legendary Pokémon.
I'm waiting for my lord N to return. He can talk to Pokémon. If he comes back, we can find out what the Pokémon here want.
We're taking care of the Pokémon whose Trainers we can't find. I know it seems arrogant, but it's a small way to make up for what we've done.
You can't change the past, but you can change the future! That's why I changed my outfit. I can still fit into the old one, though! Really!
This Pokémon has become attached to me. That's why I'm treating it like a friend and not like a tool!
Bwoaf bowoaf!
Swwaaa!
Scrarara!
Skreeree...
Yeowwln!
VAR(256, 1): What? I heard that Team Plasma left many Pokémon behind when they fled. And I'm helping find their real Trainers... That aside... Since you're here, you should have a battle with me before you go!
VAR(256, 1): Hey, VAR(256, 0), have a battle with me before you go!
VAR(256, 1): Here I come!
VAR(256, 1): Well, that's all right too, I guess!
VAR(256, 1): I suppose that's it. If winning in battles is strength, then believing that your Pokémon will come back and waiting for its return is also strength. Doing what you think is right no matter what anyone else says, like these guys do, is strength, too. VAR(256, 0)! Come back tomorrow! I'll take you on again! That's my way of saying thanks!
Kwip yip!
VAR(256, 0) received Zorua!

There are medicinal herbs that make Pokémon healthy.
The medicinal herbs imported from another region work very well! But Pokémon don't seem to like them, because they taste a little bitter.

Here it is! Your Moomoo Milk!
Oh, my! Your Bag is full!
Oh, my! You don't have enough money!
Please buy it next time! Just so you know, our Moomoo Milk is straight from the farm. It's super fresh!

One bottle
One dozen

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all sold out. That Charles guy bought everything I had.
You! Glad you came! You want something good?
Then, show me a Pokémon Lv. 30 or more!
Oh! Strong! You, great! Take this!
Oh! You--not so good yet! After training Pokémon, come back here again!
You, modest! You should just want something good!
You! Glad you came! Get good at Expert Belts! If a Pokémon has an Expert Belt, the power of its moves is slightly boosted when they are super effective!
There must be a convenient town where everything is imported and everything is available.
Somewhere, there's a laid-back town where people value the year's seasons. I heard we've imported a lot of goods from that town!
Looking at seasonal vegetables is fun. Because when the seasons change, the vegetables available change!
Whenever we come to the market, vegetables of all seasons are available. Isn't that a marvel?
Goods carried away from Driftveil arrive in a town somewhere else... Yeah. The world is connected.

Hi there, VAR(256, 0)!
It's nice to finally be able to talk to you in person! I'm Professor Juniper!
You accepted the Pokédex and came all the way out here with your partners... Here, I'll evaluate your progress for you!
So, VAR(256, 0), you've seen VAR(514, 1) Pokémon up to this point! I see! Thank you! This is a token of my gratitude.
Juniper: This Master Ball is the most powerful kind of Poké Ball. It can catch any Pokémon without fail. Journeys are about meeting Pokémon. Don't let a chance get away!
Still, I'm amazed how much Pokémon distribution changes in two years. That means my research will never end. Still, you could say that's what makes it fun...
???: Professor Juniperrrrr!
Professor Juniper: Why, if it isn't Skyla!
This is Skyla. She's Mistralton City's Gym Leader.
Skyla: Why are you surprised, Professor? You did ask for a lift in my plane to cross Twist Mountain, since you can't reach Opelucid City by foot.
Professor Juniper: Aha ha! You're right. But I have a quick favor to ask first. I want a look at Celestial Tower. Do you mind waiting till I'm through?
See you, VAR(256, 0)! Be sure to always get along with all kinds of Pokémon!
Skyla: Honestly! I can't tell if she's just laid back or if she's not paying attention to anything outside her head. The apple sure doesn't fall far from the tree.
What's next? Are you coming to my Gym to challenge me? Or are you going to follow the professor to Celestial Tower and do some training? As long as I get to battle with a strong Trainer, I'm fine either way!
Skyla: Time for a quick hop in my plane! Hey, where did Professor Juniper get to?
I wonder if she's still doing research in Celestial Tower? Mmm... Could I ask you to go get the professor? I've got to finish flight preparations at Mistralton Cargo Service!
Professor Juniper: Hi there! I hope we can get some good research done on the other side of the mountain as well. That's right! I want you to take this flight, too!
There's someone I want you to meet in Opelucid City, but we can't get through Twist Mountain right now. We'll just make a quick flight over to Lentimas Town! I'll be waiting for you in Mistralton Cargo Service!
Skyla: Hey! Professor! Wait up! Honestly... She just does everything at her own pace!
OK! You come, too!
We've arranged it so Mistralton's planes are now available for passenger service. It's not like everyone's Pokémon can use Fly!
Fly is an amazing move! Even a teeny-weeny Pokémon can carry a person easily!
That Skyla... She's even surpassed her grandpa, who was a legendary pilot!
Mistralton City used to be a desolate patch of land... This place was built through the cooperation of people and Pokémon.
Planes need a runway to fly, but Pokémon don't need a thing! But planes can carry a lot more cargo than Pokémon can.
Team Plasma went after certain Pokémon, like Purrloin! Many people had their Pokémon stolen. That's just unforgivable!
If you want to eat delicious vegetables, the ones grown in the wild are the best. Sometimes they are eaten by Pokémon... Ah, I mean we can give them to Pokémon.
Vegetables grown efficiently in a greenhouse are the best. Their nutrients all go into forming a very delicious vegetable!
Oh! You found our treasure!
Found it!
Just kidding! Our Ducklett already knows Aerial Ace. So we'll give you this TM!

Hey, what's up? I know! Since you're here, I'll tell you a little secret!
Please keep this a secret from Elesa, OK?
Know what? My Pokémon loves Berries! That's why I'm wandering all over, looking for Berries! I dream about a wonderful city somewhere that is overflowing with Berries...
The Funfest Mission “VAR(320, 0)" has been added to the Entralink.
My Pokémon's favorite Berry is the Leppa Berry! It restores PP! Isn't it a useful Berry?
Do you know the big street called VAR(313, 0)? There are a lot of unique shops there! It's so cool!

Hee-hee! I've been waiting for you. You're a tough Trainer who can face the wind and not get blown off your feet! I'm kinda excited about this battle! Why don't you and I have some fun?
You're an amazing Pokémon Trainer. My Pokémon and I are happy because for the first time in quite a while--about two years, I'd say--we could fight with our full strength. This is an official League Gym Badge. But this is just a stepping-stone.
VAR(256, 0) received the Jet Badge from Skyla.
Wow, hot stuff! With that many Gym Badges, Pokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you. Also, I want you to have this TM so that you'll always remember this Pokémon battle.
I wonder what Professor Juniper is up to? I did promise her a ride in my plane...
Two things that are both really fun: flying my own plane and having my Pokémon take me places using Fly!
Skyla: Are you and your Pokémon well? Our battle together was a ton of fun. Whenever my Pokémon think of our battle, they want to start training again. It might be a cool idea to take my plane and go on a training trip together!
Ow... Oh, I'm sorry! Allow me to apologize by giving you this Fresh Water! Take it, please.
This Gym is a wind tunnel! When the propellers in back start spinning quickly, you'll be blown away like a certain someone just was! When you think the wind will blow, stay hidden behind a wall and wait for it to stop. By the way, Flying-type Pokémon have more weaknesses than you might expect, including to Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type moves!

Professor Juniper is researching Pokémon at Celestial Tower, which is at the end of Route 7. Pay attention to the signs so you don't get lost on the way.
Looks like the Professor's reached a stopping point in her investigation. Ready to hop aboard my plane?
Hee-hee! Ready for takeoff!
Roger! Come talk to me when you're ready.
Are you ready to get aboard the plane? The sky is calling!
Professor Juniper: Hi there! Looks like I kept you waiting! Sorry... Shall we give Skyla her chance to show us her piloting skills?
OK, Skyla, we're ready. Please take us to Lentimas Town!
Bianca: Waaaaaaaaaaait! You guys! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hff...pff...I want to fly, too! I want to do some research in Reversal Mountain...hff...pff...
Professor Juniper: Bianca, you're here? You're starting to show the dedication of a serious researcher these days! OK, everyone, off we go to Lentimas Town!
Skyla: Hee-hee! Looks like everyone's here! Finally, it's time to fly the Unova skies!
Hello! This is Mistralton Cargo Service. “Deliver a lot of cargo quickly!" We can also carry passengers now, but that's up to the Gym Leader.
Hello! This is Mistralton Cargo Service. “Deliver a lot of cargo quickly!" Would you like to board the flight to Lentimas Town?
OK. We will contact Skyla, so please board the plane and wait.
OK! Feel free to fly with us anytime!
This is Mistralton Cargo Service. “Deliver a lot of cargo quickly!"
Oh! That's a Permit! That lets you enter the Nature Preserve, which is far, far away from the Unova region! Would you like to go to the Nature Preserve, then?
“Deliver a lot of cargo quickly!" This is Mistralton Cargo Service. Where would you like to fly?

When you use the move Fly, you can return to a Pokémon Center you've already visited.
If you don't know a lot about the structure of planes, how can you maintain them? Pokémon battling is the same. The more you know about Pokémon, the more you can win!
Hey! Do you have any Flying- or Psychic-type Pokémon with you?
Oh! VAR(257, 0) is with you! Would you help me get some luggage that's too high for me to reach?
Here's a little something to thank you for helping me!
Having Pokémon with you can be a big help sometimes, eh?
That's too bad. I need a Flying- or Psychic-type Pokémon to help me out.
Chulululuwa!
Hrmph! You there! Do you have the Ace Pilot Medal? We Pilots figure that's the coolest Medal of them all, so I thought a cool customer like you might have it!
If you get the Ace Pilot Medal, please come show it to me!
Ooh! Is that it? Shiny! Th-the Ace Pilot Medal... Brimming with adventure, shimmering like the sky-- the Ace Pilot Medal! So cool. Thank you for letting me see it!
“Ace Pilot"... There's a splendid sound to that. Here's to you and your Pokémon for flying freely through the skies! For my part, I'll keep working on my skills as an airplane pilot!
Welcome to the city of the skies, Mistralton City! Here's a souvenir for you.
When Pokémon hold the Sharp Beak, it increases the power of Flying-type moves!
Sweets, lovely Sweet Hearts! ♪ Check feelings between two people. If you are a great match, you can get sweet on Sweet Hearts! ♪ Meltingly sweet Sweet Hearts! ♪
Oh, uh, you? You have Sweet Hearts! Will you trade 10 Sweet Hearts for my Heart Scale?
I'm in a special mood today! Would you trade me five Sweet Hearts for a Heart Scale?
If you bring a lot of Sweet Hearts, I will trade you for something happy!
Yaaaay! I have a lot of your heart!
Oh... What a pity. What a great pity! You must have a lot of Heart Scales already.
OK... Aww...that's too bad.
Gave the Sweet Hearts and received a Heart Scale in return.

Trading Sweet Hearts you receive through Feeling Checks is one way to get Heart Scales. If you show off your Pokémon to a lady in Driftveil City, you can get Heart Scales, too.
I'm very fussy about Pokémon moves. I'm extra fussy about Technical Machines! Yes, TMs! How many TMs have you collected so far?
I'll give you something great when you collect a lot of TMs! Let me see a lot of TMs!
Oh! You're a TM Master! Thank you for showing me a lot of TMs. Use lots of different moves, and bring out your Pokémon's power!
Hmm... You have VAR(513, 0) TMs!
Oh! I've never seen some of these before! Wow! I didn't even know such TMs existed. I can tell you've selected each one with so much care. Thank you! I was thrilled to see them! As a reward, please accept this VAR(265, 0) as a gift!
There must be a lot more TMs! If you collect even more of them, I'll give you another fantastic gift!
Wow! Great job! You've got great technical points! I didn't know there were so many TMs! Thanks to you, I realized the true depth of TMs! You are a TM Master! Thank you very much!
Some kind people will give you TMs. So don't be shy! Talk to everyone!
Gym Leaders will give you a TM for sure if you beat them! But you already know that, don't you?
Do you know the Battle Subway in Nimbasa City? Defeat Trainers there and collect a lot of BP, and you can get TMs!
I don't know who would be careless enough to drop them, but you can sometimes find TMs in places where you'd least expect them.
You can also buy TMs at Poké Marts! They're a bit expensive, though.

Brycen: In the past, when I was hurt and depressed, Alder shared this with me... There is strength in being with other people and Pokémon. Receiving their support makes you stronger.
I worked as a Gym Leader, and I came to understand what he meant by that. My desire became to strengthen this relationship that makes everyone stronger--the relationship between people and Pokémon. By focusing on the path of an actor, I want to make everyone think that living together with Pokémon is exciting and wonderful.
Teaching is being taught... Excuse me, it's time for training.

Are you here to battle Grandpa? Yep! Opelucid City's Gym Leader, Drayden, is my grandpa. We're not really related, though!

Still, your Pokémon really respect you! I feel how much fun your Pokémon are having, even from inside their Poké Balls! Good luck!
Still, your Pokémon really respect you! I feel how much fun they're having, even from inside their Poké Balls! Good luck!
Drayden: I'll show you the way. Follow me.
This way.
We're here. OK! Come inside.
What was that?
This world of ice...
Haxorus! Use Dragon Tail!
Rarh raaaah!
That's enough, Haxorus!
Not only did the ice stay unbroken, there's not even a scratch on it! What's going on?
???: I don't think that's going to work.
Drayden: I remember you from N's Castle.
Zinzolin: It's bitter cold. I'm shivering. I'm suffering, but I'm alive! It's what the essence of life feels like! It's proof of my existence! But that's enough of philosophy. Here are the facts for your admiration: This ice was specially created by Team Plasma's technology. As long as we have our secret weapon, you'll never be able to melt or break this ice!
Let me explain our purpose here. Drayden, hand over the DNA Splicers! Opelucid City is a city where the past and the future are entwined. Could there be a more perfect place for the splicers that connect the separated Pokémon?
Drayden: Do you think someone who knows what you did two years ago will just hand them over quietly?
Zinzolin: Humph. That's what I thought you'd say. At this point, I'd like to threaten you with another volley of ice, but we can't use it for a moment... Sigh. It won't be enjoyable in this cold, but I guess we'll just search for them.
Drayden: Those foul villains!
VAR(256, 0)! I want you to help me! We're going to drive Team Plasma out of Opelucid City!
Team Plasma: Pokémon are pawns! They're a means to an end. That's what I was taught! Don't think about it too much. It's easier that way!
Team Plasma: How can this be? Is that the kind of power Pokémon have when they're not treated like objects?
Team Plasma: The others were saying that the only place we haven't yet searched is the Pokémon Gym!
Team Plasma: This time, we'll take over the Unova region! You! You're trembling already? From fear or from cold--either's good!
Team Plasma: It's not over! The others will find the DNA Splicers! When they do, the Unova region is ours!
Team Plasma: Now that you mention it, I think I might have been ordered to comb the Pokémon Gym...
Team Plasma: Don't get in our way! You bother! Bother, bother, bother!
Team Plasma: How humiliating... Being bothered by a bother...
Team Plasma: Zinzolin said to stick to Drayden, because that's where we'll find anything important!
Team Plasma: I lost. I didn't stand a chance... I can't believe Haxorus blasted me all the way over here!
Team Plasma: I think Zinzolin was going to check the Pokémon Gym...
Team Plasma: I've been nursing a grudge for two years, old man. ...Even if this is the first time I've battled you!
Drayden: They're getting tougher! VAR(256, 0)! Take care of the others!
Drayden: The only one left is Zinzolin of the Seven Sages! Where could he be? Oh! What's going on at the Pokémon Gym?!
Team Plasma: That old guy won't hold back even if his opponent is a young girl.
Team Plasma: Oh, that Drayden! Where did he hide the DNA Splicers? Somewhere familiar and common, right?
Zinzolin: Oh, for crying out loud... I didn't expect to have to fight hampered by cold like this. Well, no matter! The fact that I'm shivering means I'm truly alive!
Zinzolin: You're a strong Trainer. You definitely are adept at handling Pokémon. I believe I'll take my leave, simply because I can't stand this cold. But...imagine this... A Unova region...completely...covered... in...ice. To achieve that splendor, we'll do whatever it takes to obtain the DNA Splicers.
Drayden: You're even better than I hoped. Thanks to you, we drove them off. I'm grateful to your Pokémon, also. After all that, the least I can do is heal them with this medicine.
Wait here a moment. I'll be right back.
Harrumph... That's a new record for making it there and back.
Look, VAR(256, 0). These are the DNA Splicers!
This is what they were after! We're really fortunate Team Plasma didn't get their hands on them! I don't know what their goal is, but I'm sure they're planning something wicked.
Shadow Triad: As we suspected... The hiding place was in the Gym. Well thought out. If Drayden isn't there, we can't get in. If he is there, he's the strongest guard we could possibly face. It also explains why the Pokémon Gym was remodeled. Whatever. The DNA Splicers are in our hands now.
Drayden: It's beyond my imagination to think you'd use one of the Seven Sages to find out where the splicers were!
Shadow Triad: Now you know, then. We will accomplish our goals, no matter what the cost. We don't have the ability to captivate the hearts of others like Lord N does. Instead, we will bend people to our will with brute force. Two years was a surprisingly long wait.
Drayden: If they've been stolen from us, we'll just have to take them back!
Drayden: They don't seem to be in this area. However, they can hide their presence, so be on guard as you look!
Shadow Triad: Heh heh... You don't really think you can take the DNA Splicers back, do you?
Shadow Triad: Awww. How unlucky. I don't happen to be the one holding the DNA Splicers. I was just buying time for the others to escape. Cheerio, bye-bye, whatever.
Drayden: Oh no! Ah! No! No, no, it's not your fault, VAR(256, 0). You were impressive! It's me who's let everybody down.
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
VAR(256, 0) picked up the Xtransceiver.
Drayden: Augh! If there were only two of me! Then I could protect the town and chase after them, too!
Cheren: VAR(256, 0). Drayden, glad to see you're safe as well.
Drayden: Hello, Cheren. You have certainly grown. I hear you filled in for Lenora by becoming the Gym Leader in Aspertia City.
Cheren: Thanks. We should save catching up for later. I have a good idea of where Team Plasma is hiding. The place with the lowest temperature in the Unova region right now is an area close to Humilau City. Drayden, please protect Opelucid City. VAR(256, 1) and I will find Team Plasma!
Drayden: Very well. I'll do my part--and thanks. The chase I'll leave to you! But...don't do anything reckless.
Cheren: VAR(256, 0)! I could use your help, if you're willing. You're a skilled Trainer who can go toe-to-toe with Team Plasma. That's my definition of useful. Drayden, we're off!
Drayden: Humilau City, huh... Is there anything to the north of Undella Town? VAR(256, 0), protect Pokémon from Team Plasma! All people should think for themselves about the nature of the relationship between people and Pokémon. It's not something Team Plasma gets to decide for everyone!
Drayden: Little by little, the ice is starting to melt. It's all thanks to you. As a fellow Trainer, I heartily thank you!
Why do Pokémon stay by our sides? If we could talk to them, we could ask. I'm a bit scared about what they'd say.
The memories of everyone who has lived in this city have built up over the years without changing much.
This city changes endlessly. And every change is engraved in the memories of the people who live here.
I reached heights I never could have arrived at because I had Pokémon by my side. And I believe my Pokémon became tough because they were with me!
I think some things shouldn't be changed, even if it's inconvenient.
I think some things must be changed no matter how much you love them!

Gym Leader Drayden leads Opelucid City as its mayor! He's always training by wrestling with his Pokémon.
My Pokémon show me affection, so I'm not lonely! And I return their affection even more!
There was a group that told people to release their Pokémon. They were great big liars, but it created a good opportunity to think.
After that speech, my Pokémon and I have been thinking about what's true for us.
After that speech, I've been thinking about the ideal relationship for me and my Pokémon as we move forward together.
Unova's symbols are Zekrom and Reshiram, but I wonder where they are now. Are they passing along their ancient knowledge to someone?
Pursuing ideals is different from person to person and Pokémon to Pokémon. In this city, it seems the ideal is to cherish the past.
The truth people pursue is different from person to person and Pokémon to Pokémon. In this city, it seems the truth is constant change.
The hopes of an ancient people are put into this melody... I will bring them back to us now.
Our hopes are put into this melody... I will send them to the future.
I was just reminded of Iris. Yes, the Champion. That Iris...
I wonder what kind of Champion she'll become.

Always aim for the top, like a dragon taking flight!
Trainers far stronger than I wait for you above! The ones on the right emphasize attack. The ones on the left emphasize defense. Return to the dragon's head, and step on the glowing triangle. Then, choose either right or left!
Offense is everything!
As for the Trainers above me... The one on the right fights only Triple Battles. The one on the left fights only Rotation Battles. Choose the style of battle that fits you better! Remember, they won't even battle you if you don't have three or more Pokémon with you!
Defense is everything!
The Trainers that wait above have different fighting styles. The one on the right fights only Triple Battles. The one on the left fights only Rotation Battles. Choose the style of battle you're better at! Remember, they won't even battle you if you don't have three or more Pokémon with you!
If you want to battle with me, bring three or more healthy Pokémon with you!
Triple Battles! It's a combination that raises three Pokémon's destructive power!
You are strong enough to challenge Mayor Drayden! You have the power to unleash the full force of your deep desire to win!
If you plan on battling with me, bring three or more healthy Pokémon with you!
In Rotation Battles, how the three Pokémon follow one another is key.
A battle between you and Mayor Drayden must be stirring! You must desire victory more than anything! Now, go!
Welcome. Thank you for coming. I am the Opelucid Pokémon Gym Leader, Drayden. As the mayor, I've given everything to developing the city. As a Trainer, I've simply been pursuing greater strength. But what I'm searching for now is a young Trainer who can show me a bright future. Perhaps you can show me that future, the way Iris has?

Wonderful. I'm grateful that we had a chance to meet and battle. It reminded me that Pokémon battles are about working with others to meet our challenges together.
VAR(256, 0) received the Legend Badge from Drayden!
Well, now. You've obtained seven of the Gym Badges in Unova. That means Pokémon up to Lv. 80, including those received in trades, will follow your commands obediently. I also want you to have this. It's a TM I'm particularly fond of. It's called Dragon Tail.
Dragon Tail is a move that returns the damaged Pokémon to its Poké Ball. In other words, it switches your opponent's Pokémon.
Professor Juniper asked me to tell you about the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon that created Unova. Please wait outside.
It is not the passage of time that causes Pokémon and people to age. When the energy that flows in their heart dries up, that's when they get old. The heart's energy is powered by truth, ideals, or maybe dreams... No doubt it changes depending on what you most hope for in life.
Welcome to the Opelucid City Gym! Here's some Fresh Water. Stay hydrated!
How do you like these dragon statues? This Gym is the only place in Unova with statues this size! Climb on the dragon's head and aim for the top of the other dragon, where Drayden, the Gym Leader, is waiting! Dragon-type Pokémon are his specialty. Just between you and me, Dragon types are weak to Ice-type moves as well as to moves of their own type, meaning Dragon.
You defeated the Gym Leader! Congratulations! The collision of the two dragon statues had quite an impact! Like something out of a Pokéstar Studios film!

Drayden: Let me tell you the story. It's a long story, but listen closely.
It was two years ago when the two dragon Pokémon were awakened. The black dragon Pokémon, Zekrom, pursued what is ideal, with the desire to usher in a new world of hope. And the white dragon Pokémon, Reshiram, sought what is true, with the desire to usher in a new world of goodness. Zekrom and Reshiram were once a single Pokémon.

And the black dragon Pokémon, Zekrom, pursued what is ideal, with the desire to usher in a new world of hope. Reshiram and Zekrom were once a single Pokémon.
You may wonder why it split in two. The single dragon Pokémon had helped the twin heroes bring a new region into being. But the twin heroes--the older brother who sought the truth and the younger brother who sought ideals-- sundered the region in two as they fought to see which of them was right. In that desperate hour, the single dragon Pokémon split its body into a black Pokémon and a white Pokémon, even though ideals and truth don't need to be in opposition!

In that desperate hour, the single dragon Pokémon split its body into a white Pokémon and a black Pokémon, even though ideals and truth don't need to be in opposition!
As the story goes, a third dragon Pokémon, VAR(65280, 2)KyuremVAR(65280, 0), also came into existence in that era. And there may be proof of this to be found in a treasure passed down in my family for generations: the DNA Splicers. Professor Juniper's research determined that the materials in the splicers date back to the same era as the materials used in building the Dragonspiral Tower.
Oh, the DNA Splicers are stored very safely. I guard them because I don't know what kind of power might lie within them. But here's what's been bothering me... Could there be one more dragon Pokémon? Even if Kyurem really exists, we don't know what kind of Pokémon it is. For starters, the two Pokémon the ancient Pokémon split into are both overwhelmingly powerful. So if Kyurem exists, could it be just a husk--a shell that was left over?
Boom!
Drayden: Hm? What was that sound?
Ax! Axew!
no data

I was Iris's coach! Even from the day Iris came here, she was so much stronger than me! Now, I wouldn't stand a chance!
Even Drayden can't handle a strange situation like this alone...
Drayden teaches the move Draco Meteor. It's the strongest Dragon-type move. But the Special Attack of the Pokémon that uses it drops sharply.
Concerned about your Pokémon's weight? You don't need to put it on a diet! Just let it hold this.
The weight of a Pokémon holding a Float Stone will be halved! That way, you can reduce the damage caused by weight-based moves such as Low Kick and Grass Knot.
Wh-what's going to happen to Opelucid City?
I have an item that I don't know how to use. Would you give it a try and see if you can make it work?
I know... You'll also have trouble figuring it out.
You may be able to master it. Here it is!
If a Pokémon holds a Ring Target, it can be hit even by a move that would usually have no effect. For example, a Normal-type move would hit a Ghost-type Pokémon. Mastering this item is a bit tough... Actually, it's very tough, but think how useful it could be!
It's cold... And Dragon types really don't like cold!

My Pokémon and the challenger's Pokémon. Everyone battled even though they were hurt... Thank you.
Fortitude is needed if you're going to battle, don't you think? Because both you and your opponent get hurt. But if you don't understand the pain, you'll focus on the result and forget about the bonds with your Pokémon. That's why I want to write passages full of heart and soul in my novels.

All the Pokémon on both sides battled so bravely. Even though they got hurt... Thank you.
It's important to be tough and resilient when you battle, don't you think? You have to accept that both sides will get hurt. You have to understand that the pain of losing is a natural outcome. If you just focus on winning, you can forget that the bond between you and your Pokémon is the most important thing. I try to focus on that bond in my novels. I want them to be full of heart and soul!

Whether or not you get to fight at full strength, whether or not luck smiles on you--none of that matters. Only results matter. And a loss is a loss. See, victory shines like a bright light. And right now, you and your Pokémon are shining brilliantly.
Now, I'm nothing more than the one who lost his light... But this loss will make me shine even brighter next time... If I think that way, it's not too bad. Sigh... You should take that strength and test it against the rest of the Elite Four.
Astonishing! You have defeated every member of the Pokémon League's Elite Four. But it isn't over yet. There is one more opponent against whom you must prove your strength. Check the statue in the central plaza, and continue to the final room.
Life is a serious battle, and you have to use the tools you're given. It's more important to master the cards you're holding than to complain about the ones your opponents were dealt. Let us begin. And may the best Trainer win! Contests like this are proof that you are really living...
There are bad ways to win-- and good ways to lose. What's interesting and troubling is that it's not always clear which is which. A flipped coin doesn't always land heads or tails. Sometimes it may never land at all...
There's nothing left for the loser. I guess that's not true... Everything has a meaning. I just have to use the disappointment as a motivation to get strong. That said... You should take that strength and test it against the rest of the Elite Four!

Whew! Well done! As your battles continue, aim for even greater heights!
You are a strong challenger. Walk the path you believe in with the Pokémon you believe in. The other members of the Elite Four are far more powerful than I am. Do not underestimate them!
Now... You have become the strongest Trainer in this Pokémon League. The statue in the central chamber will take you to the Champion's room.
I thank you deeply for the chance for another round of combat against you. In myself, I seek to develop the strength of a fighter. And shatter any weakness in myself! Prevailing with the force of my convictions! Victory, decisive victory, is my intention! Challenger, here I come!
There are still many strong Trainers in this Pokémon League. You should deepen your bonds with your Pokémon by battling with them.
During the days when I was young, I was wandering all the regions of the world. I was devoted only to training, in order to surpass my mentor. And when I felt so ashamed two years ago... My Pokémon were always there for me. That thought crossed my mind even though I was completely focused on our battle... You're a mysterious Trainer.

Hello, and welcome to Unity Tower! Would you like to go upstairs?
Indeed. Please step inside the elevator.
Please come again.
This is Unity Tower. Trainers from all over the world cross borders and oceans to gather here. Visit whichever floor you like! The more people you know worldwide, the more floors you can visit. Please enjoy all that we have to offer!
Right now, the number of visitors in Unity Tower is VAR(513, 11).
Wow! So you like VAR(271, 6), then!
Awesome! The ceiling is sooo high! I wonder how many of me you'd have to stack up to reach it?
Coming to Unity Tower always gets me excited! Being here always reminds me of how big the world really is!
You're a new face. Is this your first time here? Unity Tower is the place where Trainers come from all over the world. That's why I work hard every day doing security checks to protect those young Trainers. Don't loiter around here and cause trouble. ...'Kay, you can pass.
                                          
Seems like I've met you somewhere... Anyway, don't get too wound up and fall. When guests get hurt, it causes me no end of trouble. ...'Kay, you can pass.
Oh! So you're a Trainer, then! I see. You're far from family and traveling the world, huh? I suppose it's fine if you contact them once in a while. 'Kay, you can pass.
Oh, it's you. Hmm... You like trading, do you now? Well, that's all right, isn't it. You're active--just like a young person should be. 'Kay, you can pass.
Oh, it's you. Seems like you come here a lot. Do you have friends all over the world? I'd never have imagined a world like this when I was young. 'Kay, you can pass.
Oh, it's you, VAR(256, 3)! Lately, lots of Trainers have been looking for you. You're just like a movie star, aren't ya? When I was your age, the ladies used to get worked up over me. Ha ha. 'Kay, you can pass.
Hey, it's you, VAR(256, 3)! Recently, it looks like there have been lots of global Trainers like you. That means--how do I put it--world peace can't be far off! Should I get my hopes up? 'Kay, pass on through!
Oh, it's you, VAR(256, 3)! It feels like since you've started coming, Unity Tower has gotten busier. There's been a lot more work for this old guy, but that's a problem I'm happy to have. Keep up the good work!
Hey, VAR(256, 3). You've managed to trade with folks in even more places, huh? That's really something! I'd imagine your Pokédex is getting pretty full, then? Wow, you're amazing! 'Kay, pass on through.
Hey, VAR(256, 3). Unity Tower is as lively as ever with people who come here to see you. Well, enjoy yourself today!
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3)! What? F-fifty countries?! I've never seen a Trainer who has traded with folks in over 50 countries! How in the world did you manage that? 'Kay, please pass through--and feel free to wander around!
Hey, it's you, VAR(256, 3). After trading with this many people, you must have friends all over the world! Ha ha. If you go on a trip, no worries about not knowing anyone, huh? 'Kay, please pass through!
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3)! I almost feel like I don't need to bother with a security check for you anymore. You can go ahead and pass. ...Gotcha! I've been a security guard for 30 years! I know trouble just waits for you to let your guard down. ...'Kay, you can pass.
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3). I'll just do a brief security check. ...W-what's this? Ooh, it's a kind of gum I've never seen! Is it a new brand? Maybe I'll buy some later. 'Kay, you can pass.
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3). Just a little more, and you'll have traded with every place here, huh? It's really reassuring to me that kids like you are going to be the ones running the world! Just a little more to go. You can do it! 'Kay, you can pass!
It's you, VAR(256, 3)! I already heard! You've finally managed to trade with people from every location, right? It might just be me, but Unity Tower feels more exciting when you visit. I'm sure it's happy to see you. Hey, VAR(256, 3), I'd like to give my thanks as the Unity Tower guard for making this building out in the middle of nowhere so lively. 'Kay, you can pass. Think of this place as your own backyard and feel free to go where you please.
Please select a floor.
Hey, you over there! Come here for a second.
Don't just loiter around and cause trouble.
Don't get too wound up. If you run around, fall, and get hurt, it'll cause me no end of trouble.
I suppose it's fine if you contact them once in a while. I'm sure it'll make your folks happy.
That's all right. You're active--just like a young person should be. Do your best!
Do you know people all over the world? I never would've imagined a world like this when I was young.
When I was your age, the ladies used to get worked up over me. Ha ha!
Recently, it looks like there have been lots of global Trainers like you.
It feels like since you started coming, Unity Tower has gotten busier. Keep up the good work!
I'd imagine your Pokédex is getting pretty full, then? Well, that's really something.
Unity Tower is as lively as ever with people who come here to see you. Well, hope you enjoy yourself today.
How in the world did you manage to trade with so many different places?
You must know a lot of people in different places in the world. Ha ha. Even if you go on a trip, no worries about not knowing anyone, huh?
I've been a guard for 30 years. Today, all is well, too. Mmm... That's great!
I think I'll try buying that new gum next time.
When I see you, I suddenly feel very sure that the future will be full of hope.
When you visit, Unity Tower gets exciting! Think of this place as your own backyard and feel free to go where you please.

VAR(256, 7): Know what? I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! When you get to know people from faraway places, you want to visit far away! Hey, VAR(256, 3), have you been to VAR(293, 1), where I live? It's awesome, so try to visit sometime. VAR(271, 10) there is great!
???: Hello, VAR(256, 3). Remember me? It's me, it's me! VAR(256, 7)! From VAR(293, 1)! We traded VAR(258, 5) and VAR(258, 9), right? I want to say thanks again! I really adore VAR(258, 5)!

Come to VAR(293, 1) sometime, OK, VAR(256, 3)? It's a super place!
VAR(256, 7): Oh, if it isn't VAR(256, 3)! How are you? I didn't think there were many people who liked VAR(271, 10). I found several people with the same hobby after trading with Trainers from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! VAR(293, 1) didn't have so many. Hmm. I guess the rest of the world is definitely a little different!

VAR(256, 7): The VAR(258, 5) I got from you! ...It's awesome! Thank you! I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! But VAR(258, 5) is special! VAR(256, 3)! Someday, we should enjoy VAR(271, 10) together in VAR(293, 1)! Until we meet again, VAR(256, 3)!

The world's a magical place! Our meeting is also magical! Let's trade again sometime, VAR(256, 3)!
???: Hey! I remember you! You're VAR(256, 3), right? Do you remember me? It's VAR(256, 7)! Hee hee! Remember? I'm from VAR(293, 1)! Thanks for trading me VAR(258, 5) that time! Is VAR(258, 9) doing well? Trading Pokémon with you was really inspiring! It's really nice to see you again, VAR(256, 3)! Let's trade again sometime!
VAR(256, 7): Oh! Hi, VAR(256, 3)! Hee hee. Know what?! I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! Isn't it awesome? Great? Hee hee! Oh! Oh!

VAR(256, 7): Hello, VAR(256, 3)! Where do the people you've traded with come from? I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)!

I hope we can share our hobbies with people all over the world! Aah! I've gotten myself all worked up! Let's trade again sometime, VAR(256, 3)!
VAR(256, 7): Know what? I thought this after trading with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! It's normal for people to be different! If the things you like are different, your hobbies will be different, too! There's no reason for everyone to like VAR(271, 10). I think that's interesting! Because when you do something different, doesn't it feel like your world has become larger somehow? Stepping out of VAR(293, 1) sometime will be good for sure!
VAR(256, 7): Hey, VAR(256, 3). Have you ever been to VAR(293, 1)? You can enjoy VAR(271, 10) there, and it's a pretty nice place. But I thought this after I tried trading with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! I'm sure there are just as many nice things in other places. Don't you get super excited when you think about that? OK, I'll see you later, VAR(256, 3)! Let's trade again, OK!
???: Y-you, you're, um, VAR(256, 3), right? ...Do I remember you? What? M-me? I'm VAR(256, 7) from VAR(293, 1). Th-thank you very much for trading VAR(258, 5) that one time. Your Pokémon... It's really nice. ...VAR(258, 9) is pretty nice, right? I'm surprised to see you here! ...But I'm happy, too... A-hyuk hyuk!
VAR(256, 7): Ah hyuk hyuk! I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! Everyone has different hobbies. It's really interesting... Wha--? My hobby? It's VAR(271, 10). Ah yup! If you ever feel like coming to my home, VAR(293, 1), you should! I'm sure it'll be a fun trip for you.
VAR(256, 7): M-my hobby is VAR(271, 10)...but have you met other people through trading who like it? I've traded with people from VAR(514, 8) place(s), but everyone has different hobbies. If you live somewhere different, your hobbies must be different, too. ...Well, anyway. That's good, too.
VAR(256, 7): M-my hobby is VAR(271, 10), but... What about you? ...Phew. T-truth is, I'm not very comfortable talking with people. Despite that, I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)... And I also got your VAR(258, 5)... Hyuk hyuk. I-I think I want to trade some more. Thank you. Hope we can trade again sometime.
VAR(256, 7): I-I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! And some of them liked VAR(271, 10), too... Even on the other side of the world, some people have the same hobby as me... By the way, have you ever been to VAR(293, 1), where I live? It's a fun place, so I think you might like to visit...
VAR(256, 7): H-have you traded Pokémon with people from a lot of places? F-for me, I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)... Um, err... Have you ever been to where I live, VAR(293, 1)? Th-there are people who like VAR(271, 10). Oh, of course I like that, too! I-it's a very nice place, so come visit sometime...
???: You... You're... VAR(256, 3), right? It's me! You know, VAR(256, 7) from VAR(293, 1) in VAR(292, 0)! ...Do you remember me? Tee hee! I'm happy to see you again. Thanks for giving me VAR(258, 5) that time. Is VAR(258, 9) doing well? Meeting again must be fate! Tee hee! Looking forward to seeing you again!
VAR(256, 7): Come on, how many places are the people you've traded Pokémon with from? I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! It's a little scary trading with strangers... ...But it also makes my heart race a bit. Sometimes I meet people who love VAR(271, 10), too! ...Tee hee! Trading has become a little more fun, hasn't it?
VAR(256, 7): Umm... How is VAR(258, 9)? No, if it's fine, that's all that matters. VAR(258, 5) is doing great... Very good... Yes. Would you come to VAR(293, 1) sometime soon? It's a nice place where you can enjoy VAR(271, 10). ... ...Come for sure, OK! Tee hee!
VAR(256, 7): Tee hee! Hey, VAR(256, 3). What is your hobby? Mine is VAR(271, 10). ...What do you think? How many places have the people you traded with come from? I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! I'm going to trade more and more, so I can find people who like VAR(258, 5)... Tee hee hee. Well, I'll see you again, VAR(256, 3). Let's trade again sometime...
VAR(256, 7): Have you ever been to VAR(293, 1)? It's a lovely place. I hope you come sometime. I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! I've worked hard...huh? You can learn about the hobbies of the Trainers you trade with. Kind of fun, isn't it? ...Me? I like VAR(271, 10). Expecting something different? Tee hee.
VAR(256, 7): Tee hee. How many places are the people you've traded Pokémon with from? Right now for me it's this many places: VAR(514, 8)... But, I want to trade more and more... Because if I do, I might meet someone who likes VAR(271, 10) and VAR(258, 5), too! ...It feels like destiny! Tee hee. And someday, I'll have them come visit VAR(293, 1)... It's a very nice place...

Hee hee! I hope we can enjoy our hobbies with people all over the world! Aah! I've gotten myself all worked up! Let's trade again sometime, VAR(256, 3)!
VAR(256, 7): You know what? I thought this up after trading with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). It's normal for people to be different! If the things you like are different, your hobbies will be, too! There's no reason for everyone to like VAR(271, 10). I think that's interesting! Because when you are doing something different, doesn't it feel like your world has become larger? Stepping out of VAR(292, 0) sometimes is good for sure!

Don't you get super worked up when you think about that? OK, I'll see you later, VAR(256, 3)! Let's trade again, OK!

VAR(256, 7): M-my hobby is VAR(271, 10), but... What about you? ...Phew. T-truth is, I'm not very comfortable talking with people.

Hope we can trade again sometime.

Let's trade again sometime...
VAR(256, 7): Have you ever been to VAR(292, 0)? It's a lovely place. I hope you come sometime. I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). I've worked hard...huh? You can learn about the hobbies of Trainers you trade with. Kind of fun, isn't it? ...Me? I like VAR(271, 10). Expecting something different? Tee hee!
VAR(256, 7): Tee hee! How many places do they come from, these people you've traded with? For me, it's this many places: VAR(514, 8)... But, I want to trade more and more... Because if I do, I might meet someone who likes VAR(271, 10) and VAR(258, 5), too! ...It feels like destiny! Tee hee! And someday, I'll have them come visit VAR(292, 0)... It's a very nice place...

VAR(256, 7): Hey there, VAR(256, 3). I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). Whoa, people sure do have a lot of different hobbies! What? My hobby? It's VAR(271, 10), I suppose. I enjoy it for some reason. Are there a lot of people near you who like VAR(271, 10)? In VAR(292, 0), where I live, I suppose there are a few.

Hey, VAR(256, 3), if you have a chance to come to VAR(292, 0), let's enjoy VAR(271, 10) together. I'm sure it will be fun!
VAR(256, 7): ... ... Huh? What? Sorry, I was spacing out. My hobby. Weeeelll. ...VAR(271, 10), I guess? How about you, VAR(256, 3)? Speaking of hobbies, I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). And I finally found a person with the same hobby. Ha ha! Those things make me happy. I want to trade again, now. VAR(256, 3), let's trade again sometime!
VAR(256, 7): Why, VAR(256, 3)! Hello! Are you here because you've traded Pokémon with people living far away? Hee hee! My Pokémon are cute, but there is a special cuteness about Pokémon you've traded with other people. I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). I want to trade with still more people. You see, there are lots of people who like VAR(271, 10), too. Talking to Trainers has become quite a bit of fun. Hey, VAR(256, 3). Let's trade again sometime, OK? Promise!
VAR(256, 7): Oh! VAR(256, 3)! Hi! Know what?! Know what?! I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). Not bad, eh? Hee hee! And I'm going to keep trading! Hm? My hobby? Well... Ummm... VAR(271, 10), I guess! It's fun! Hey, VAR(256, 3), take care of VAR(258, 9). It's very sweet, so be sure to take extra good care of it!

Hi, VAR(256, 0)!
VAR(256, 1): Hey! You get a Pokémon yet? There aren't any Pokémon Trainers around here, and I'm getting bored!
What's that? ...
A person named Bianca is giving you a Pokémon? Really?!
VAR(256, 1)'s Sister: VAR(256, 0)... If you get a Pokémon, take really, really good care of it, OK?
VAR(256, 1): Yeah...
OK! Let's go get your Pokémon! There's something I have to do! And to do that, I need someone I can trust besides my partner Pokémon. A person I can trust! That's right! I'm talking about you! You seem like you've got good instincts!
You head on home.
OK, big brother! Bye-bye, VAR(256, 0)!
VAR(256, 1): All riiight! Let's go find that person named Bianca!
                         
VAR(256, 1): Still... You're really lucky to get a Pokémon!
VAR(256, 1): Once you get a Pokémon, you leave on a journey right away. When you do that, I'm gonna have you help me out!
VAR(256, 1): Hurry up already! Let's look for that Bianca person!
VAR(256, 1): Wait! I was just in the Pokémon Center, and there wasn't anyone like that there.
VAR(256, 1): The Trainers' School was just finished! No one is allowed inside until a Teacher, or better said, a Gym Leader, starts working there!
VAR(256, 1): That goes to Route 19. If we don't find Bianca here in town, I'll go check it for you! 'Cause I already have a Pokémon!
VAR(256, 1): Oh, I get it! The outlook is Aspertia's most famous spot! I'll bet Bianca is up there looking at the scenery! C'mon! Go get your Pokémon already!
VAR(256, 1): Listen, there's no way I got this wrong!
VAR(256, 1): Listen, there's no way I got this wrong!
???: It's sooo pretty!
Hey there! Don't you agree?
Oh! My name is Bianca! I'm the assistant of the Pokémon Professor--Professor Juniper. By the way, I'm looking for someone. Do you know a person named VAR(256, 0)?
Oh, wait! You're VAR(256, 0)! Wooow! You're ex-act-ly like what I heard!
Oh, wait! You're VAR(256, 0)! Wooow! You're ex-act-ly like what I heard!
                                           
Bianca: Nice to meet you! I have a really important request to ask you! Will you help us complete the Pokédex?
Oh, wow, thanks! Your support will help Professor Juniper's research move forward! Anyway, filling up the Pokédex is totally fun!
N-no way... I-I must have misheard you. Right? This is a very important request. Will you please help us complete the Pokédex?
VAR(256, 1): See! Bianca was here, right? Now, c'mon! Go and get your Pokémon!
VAR(256, 1): See! Bianca was here, right? Now, c'mon! Go and get your Pokémon!
Bianca: OK, then! Ta-daaa! In here is the Pokémon that will be your partner!

VAR(48386)The Grass-type Pokémon VAR(48386)VAR(257, 1)
Choose a Pokémon.
Is this the Pokémon you want?
Pick this one!
YES
NO
VAR(256, 0) chose VAR(257, 1)!
Bianca: Oh, wow! You and VAR(257, 2) are a perfect match! By the way, would you like to give a nickname to the Pokémon you chose?
Bianca: Oh, OK, gotcha. You're not going to give it a nickname.
Bianca: VAR(258, 0)! Is that the nickname you want?
Bianca: VAR(258, 0)! That is such a great name!
Bianca: Now you've got your Pokémon, so I'll give you this, too--a Pokédex!
VAR(256, 0) received the VAR(65280, 2)PokédexVAR(65280, 0)!
Bianca: You want to know what it does? The Pokédex is a high-tech device that automatically records the Pokémon you encounter! So Professor Juniper wants you to carry this Pokédex, visit a lot of places, and meet all the Pokémon in the Unova region!
Still, that Professor Juniper! The normal thing to do is to get an OK before sending someone clear out here, right?
VAR(256, 1): Heeey! How long are you planning on keeping me waiting, anyway? Hey! What's that?
So that's your partner, huh? That's great! My sister already said so, but take really, really good care of your Pokémon! Got it? What's that you're holding there?
Bianca: It's a Pokédex!
VAR(256, 1): Please give me a Pokédex, too! I want to get stronger! If I have a Pokédex, I can learn more about Pokémon... That'll make me tougher, right?
Bianca: Um...who are you again?
I'm VAR(256, 1)! I'm going to travel the Unova region with my Pokémon partner in order to search for something very important!
Bianca: Well, OK! I don't really get it, but going on a journey is always good! Anyway, I just happen to have another Pokédex on me! It looks like Pokémon distribution has really changed compared to two years ago, so the more, the merrier!
Bianca: Ooh, I thought of something cool! You both have Pokémon, right? Why don't you have a Pokémon battle?
VAR(256, 1): Let's see how good a Trainer you are! I'll use my VAR(257, 3) that I raised from an Egg!
VAR(256, 1): I lost... This is different than battling with wild Pokémon! Well, whatever. I'm just happy to know you're a Trainer I can count on! Cool. I'm heading off first! Get stronger!
VAR(256, 1): That was good enough for your first battle! Cool. I'm heading off first! Get stronger!
Bianca: The Pokémon on both sides did their best! But this little one is still weak, so battle with it and make it stronger!
All righty, let's go make your Pokémon better at the Pokémon Center! It's like the best place ever for Pokémon who battle and get hurt!
Bianca: The Pokémon Center is the same no matter where you are! Let's go inside!
Mom: Oh! Nice to meet you! You must be Bianca, right? And VAR(256, 0) picked VAR(257, 2), then! Hee hee. Looking good!
Oh! I almost forgot! Here! Take these! They're Running Shoes!
VAR(256, 0) received a pair of VAR(65280, 2)Running ShoesVAR(65280, 0)!
Mom: A perfect fit! I'll read the instructions to you! “Hold the B Button to run faster than normal. Put on the Running Shoes and race around to your heart's content!" Now, you and VAR(257, 2) can run anywhere you want!
VAR(256, 1)'s Sister: Um... This is from me!
                           
Bianca: Why are there two Town Maps?
VAR(256, 1)'s Sister: I want you to give the other one to my big brother!
Mom: That's a good idea! Even if it is a single road to the ocean, having a Town Map is always nice. I mean, if you use a Town Map, you'll know all about what the Unova region is like!
Bianca: Aww, you guys! Just watching this makes me happy! C'mon, we're headed for Route 19! I'll teach you how to catch a Pokémon!
Mom: Bon voyage! Take VAR(257, 2) and go see many different Pokémon and people with your own eyes!
VAR(256, 1)'s Sister: Get along with your Pokémon!
Bianca: Heeey!
Bianca: Yoo-hoo!
How was it? How did your Pokémon battle with the Gym Leader go? Oh! If it isn't the Basic Badge! Wow! Amazing! And you just set off on your journey with your Pokémon! You definitely have potential as a Trainer! I'm sure of it! This is from me! It's the TM for the move Return.
When a Pokémon knows Return, the more it gets along with the Trainer, the more powerful the move is!
Still, that Cheren...
Cheren: Bianca! It's been two years, hasn't it?
Bianca: Oh wow!
Wh-what's up?
Cheren: I thought it would be a good idea to register each other in the Xtransceiver!
Now, you can communicate with me from your Xtransceiver.
Bianca: M-me, too!
I registered Professor Juniper for you, too!
The Xtransceiver is ringing!
VAR(256, 0) picked up the Xtransceiver!
Bianca: Hey, VAR(256, 0)! Isn't Professor Juniper cool? If you talk to her on the Xtransceiver, she'll evaluate the completeness of your Pokédex or tell you a lot about how Pokémon evolve! And you can call us, too, of course!
I'll tell you how well you and your Pokémon are getting along, OK?!
Cheren: Bianca makes a good point. I'll tell you what I know about Pokémon Abilities and Pokémon type matchups.
VAR(256, 1): Are you the Gym Leader? One, two, three--let's battle!
Cheren: You look like a tough Trainer. Understood. Please come into my Pokémon Gym!
VAR(256, 1): What was that weak answer?! I'm definitely going to take you down!
Bianca: Being a Gym Leader is even harder than I imagined.
The next thing is to make it so you can use the C-Gear. The C-Gear is a cool device for communications, such as Infrared Connection or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
VAR(256, 0) obtained the VAR(65280, 1)C-GearVAR(65280, 0)!
Turn on the C-Gear and establish communications?
YES
NO
Some functions of the C-Gear will be restricted. Is that OK?
Wireless communications are turned OFF. Turn wireless communications ON in the System Settings. Error code: 50699
Check this! The C-Gear was activated, and that screen showed up! If you touch the “?" icon in the bottom-right corner of the C-Gear screen, you can read about the C-Gear. Like, what are you going to do now? You know, there's another Pokémon Gym in Virbank City, which is just past Floccesy Town.
If you want to turn on the C-Gear, touch the Power symbol at the bottom right of the C-Gear screen. Then, after turning on the power, if you touch the “?" icon in the bottom-right corner of the C-Gear screen, you can read about the C-Gear. Like, what are you going to do now? You know, there's another Pokémon Gym in Virbank City, which is just past Floccesy Town.
VAR(256, 1): Hey! My sis has something she wants to tell you!
VAR(256, 1)'s Sister: Um... VAR(256, 0)... My Purrloin... It evolved, but thank you very much for finding it!
VAR(256, 1): There's more, right?
VAR(256, 1)'s Sister: Um... VAR(256, 0)... These days, I've been having dreams about a Pokémon. A Pokémon called Zoroark. It was calling your name, VAR(256, 0)!
VAR(256, 1): I don't really get it, but I hear that the Zoroark from her dreams is on Victory Road! That's what she wanted to say. Be seeing you!
Oh! Almost forgot. Congrats on becoming the Champion! I called it! You've got good instincts!
Trainers are the ones who have their Pokémon partners battle. I hear Gym Leaders are really strong Trainers!
So about the Gym Leader Cheren... A few years ago he traveled all over the Unova region with his Pokémon.
I wish the Trainers' School would hurry up and open! There's so much about Pokémon I want to know!
I know lots about Pokémon! 'Cause I learned so much at the Trainers' School!
The view of Route 19 from the outlook is Aspertia City's pride and joy.
The power of science is amazing! Now you can use communications to play with a hundred people at the same time!
People go on journeys and become adults. Maybe I should leave this city, too...
Sometimes wild Pokémon attack people! But the ones you befriend, the ones that stay by your side, are Pokémon, too!
Your mom's really good at getting Pokémon to rest and making them feel better!
Oh, hi! Why, Aurea Juniper! It's been far too long! What can I do for you? ... Wow! A Pokédex... For my child? Why, that's great! I think a journey would be a wonderful experience!
What now? She's already here? Oh, for Pete's sake. You never change. Once you've decided on something, you just start going. OK! Bianca, right? A big, green hat. Got it. OK! No worries!
This is Aspertia City. A city that reaches for the sky.

I asked Alder from Floccesy Town to teach here. He declined, saying it was the era of young people now.
Do you use items during Pokémon battles? If you'd like, try using this!
Use X Defend to make a Pokémon's Defense go up! A Trainer's judgment about whether to use items or moves is important in battle!
There's a technique that enables you to cancel evolution! Here, I'll read the textbook to you. “You can surprise a Pokémon and stop its evolution by pressing the B Button when a Pokémon is evolving."
You know how you can have your Pokémon hold items? Well, it seems like they don't know how to use items made by people, like Potions.
Normal-type Pokémon are weak to Fighting-type Pokémon. But the only Pokémon around here like that are the Riolu in Floccesy Ranch... If you're going to battle with a Fire-, Water-, or Grass-type Pokémon, it'll be a simple test of strength!
The blackboard explains Pokémon status changes in battle.
What do you want to read about?
If poisoned, a Pokémon steadily loses HP when battling. The poison lingers after the battle. To cure it, use an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat and may prevent movement. It remains after battle, so use a Parlyz Heal.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to attack. The Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if a battle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep. Wake it up using an Awakening.
A burn reduces the Attack stat and steadily reduces the victim's HP. A burn lingers after battle. Cure a burn using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely helpless. The Pokémon may thaw out on its own, but if a battle ends while it is frozen, it will stay frozen. Thaw it out using an Ice Heal.

===============================
Text File: 171
===============================
???: You must be a challenger!
Welcome to Aspertia City's Pokémon Gym. I'm Cheren, the Gym Leader! Hm? Well, maybe I'd better say that I just became the Gym Leader! More importantly, we need to prepare before welcoming you to the Gym.
We have a challenger! You two, take your places!
If you can defeat these two, then I'll be your opponent!
If you want to battle me, please defeat those two first, OK?
Just as this is your first Gym challenge, this is my first Pokémon battle as a Gym Leader! Let's both do our best and have a battle we can be proud of!
That battle has made me feel really glad you were my first challenger as a Gym Leader... I give you this in honor of the strength you and your Pokémon showed!
VAR(256, 0) received the Basic Badge from Cheren!
Here is your first Gym Badge, the Basic Badge! This is an important milestone! With this Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 20 will obey you, including traded Pokémon. And I want you to take this!
TM83 can teach your Pokémon the move Work Up! When you use Work Up while battling, it raises the user's Attack and Sp. Atk. By the way, TMs can be used as many times as you want!
In the Unova region, there are eight Pokémon Gyms and eight Gym Badges! If you're a Trainer, you could collect all of them! That will make it easier to fill the pages of the Pokédex as well! Yes, two years ago, Pokédex in hand, I left on a journey with my friends.
Cheren: You should decide what you're going to do from here out! Don't worry about losing your way-- you have Pokémon by your side!
Cheren saw potential in me and made me a Trainer in this Gym!
If you can defeat the girl, too, you can challenge the Gym Leader!
Wow! You can challenge the Gym Leader!
The reason Cheren saw potential in me was there was no one else...? No way! Even if that is the case, I just have to get stronger!
Now I'll show you all of the things I learned from Cheren!
I guess you can battle a little! Think you can beat the other Trainer?
OK. You're pretty good! But, can you beat Cheren?
I have to learn even more about my Pokémon!
Hello! I'm Clyde, the guide for Trainers who challenge Pokémon Gyms. Thank you for taking on the Gym! Take this to commemorate your debut!
Pokémon Gyms are facilities for testing Trainers' abilities! Put simply, if you can defeat the Gym Leader, it means you're a really good Trainer!
If you run out of Pokémon that can fight during a Pokémon battle, you lose! So having a lot of Pokémon with you might work to your advantage!
I hope you'll remember the wonderful moment in which you received that Badge forever.

Bianca: OK! I'll show you around the Pokémon Center!
The Pokémon Center heals Pokémon for free! You should bring your Pokémon here anytime they are weak.
I'll heal your Pokémon. Hand me your Poké Ball for a sec!
Next, I'll explain the PC!
This square thing is a PC! Any Trainer is free to use it! You can deposit Pokémon in it. Also, you can withdraw Pokémon from it!
The next thing is over here!
This is the Poké Mart! Here you can buy and sell many different items! The Poké Balls you use to catch Pokémon can also be bought at the Poké Mart!
Here, VAR(256, 0), I'll give you some Poké Balls!
Here, VAR(256, 0), I'll give you some Poké Balls!
Bianca: Next up! I'll show you how to use those Poké Balls! Follow me!
Oh? Your VAR(257, 1)...
Its Nature is VAR(264, 2)! With a Pokémon like that by your side, I'm sure you'll have a fun journey!
All right! Here's some advice from a guy who spends all of his time in Pokémon Centers! When your Pokémon's HP goes down, make sure to restore it!

VAR(256, 0)! I'm home!
Do you know Professor Juniper? She's a famous Pokémon researcher. Actually, she's an old friend of mine, and she called me today for the first time in ages!
This is out of the blue, but, VAR(256, 0)! Do you want to have a Pokémon?
I'll ask you again. Do you want a Pokémon?
What?! That's a shock!
OK! Step one completed! Well then, do you know what a Pokédex is?
I knew you would! Isn't it amazing how it automatically records Pokémon you encounter?
I see... It's an amazing device that automatically records the Pokémon you encounter!
Yet another question! You want a Pokédex, right?
OK! Step two completed!
I don't mean to be selfish, but I'd like it if you were a bit more agreeable. Having a Pokédex means traveling around the world! Think about that for a second. So I'll ask you again... You want a Pokédex, right?
VAR(256, 0)! Your course of action has been set! A girl named Bianca has come here to meet you! She's Professor Juniper's assistant. I was told to simply look for a big, green hat! That's right! You're going to go look for Bianca. And then you'll get a Pokédex and a Pokémon to be your partner!
VAR(256, 0)! Your course of action has been set! A girl named Bianca has come here to meet you! She's Professor Juniper's assistant. I was told to simply look for a big, green hat! That's right! You're going to go look for Bianca. And then you'll get a Pokédex and a Pokémon to be your partner! Oh! Your Xtransceiver's in your Bag, right? Do you know how to open your Bag?
I'll send you off with these words from “Adventure Rules." “The X Button is vitally important for Trainers." OK! Off with you now! Go look for Bianca, OK!
The girl's name is Bianca. I was told you should look for a big, green hat! She might be lost because this is her first time here. Go look for her!
Oh? Are the both of you out looking for Bianca? You still haven't found her? Look for the big, green hat!
Bianca: I was just talking to your mom! She told me an amazing story about Professor Juniper!
Mom: Welcome back! Hey, how are your Pokémon? Well, why don't you rest for a moment? Nothing but hard work will wear you out!
Mom: Looking good! Both you and your Pokémon seem raring to go!
Mom: The same step is a lot more wonderful if it's made while thinking about Pokémon!
Mom: When I was younger, I worked at Pokémon Centers all over the place!
Mom: I wish we knew how Pokémon felt...
Mom: Seeing energetic Pokémon fills me up with energy, too! It reminds me of when I used to work in the Pokémon Center!
Mom: Welcome home, VAR(256, 0)! Seems like you've had a rough time. Rest here awhile. ...
Mom: OK! You and your Pokémon are full of energy! This is a little advice from your mother! When your Pokémon's stamina, I mean HP, goes down, heal them regularly at the Pokémon Center! If you're going on a long adventure, stock up on Potions at the Poké Mart! I'm cheering for you! Have a wonderful journey!
Mom: Welcome home, VAR(256, 0)!
Hmm. I barely recognize you! It seems like you've seen and thought about a lot and grown into an adult! Oh! Seems we're about to have a visitor!
???: Oh, so you're VAR(256, 0)! My name's Juniper! The one who gave you your Pokédex is my daughter!
Mom: It's been a long time, Professor Juniper!
Cedric Juniper: Has it been that long? I can't remember... Well, that's not really why I came.
VAR(256, 0)! To commemorate your entering the Hall of Fame, I'm going to upgrade your Pokédex!
VAR(256, 0)'s Pokédex was upgraded!
Cedric Juniper: I'll tell you what I upgraded, so why don't you ask? Well, actually, it's really simple! I made it so you can register all of the National Pokédex Pokémon.
Mom: Wow! That's amazing! That must be why you and your daughter are Pokémon Professors!
Cedric Juniper: Ha ha ha! Flattery won't get you anywhere! Well then, think I'd best be taking my leave!
Listen up! There are still many, many Pokémon in this world! Sometimes Pokémon attack each other for food. Sometimes they help one another. They protect each other's places. I'd be happy if you think about things like that while looking at the Pokédex.
Mom: He left... Oh, that's right! VAR(256, 0)! I have a present for you, too!
Mom: No matter what you do, your time is yours and your Pokémon's alone! So decide what you want to do for yourself and do it! I enjoy my own time in my own way, too!
       
It's a Wii console! It has a Wii Remote!
It's a brand-new bed!
VAR(256, 0) checked the PC. Adventure Rule No. 1 The X Button opens the menu! Adventure Rule No. 2 Record your progress with SAVE.
It's an award for completing the Unova Pokédex!
It's an award for completing the National Mode Pokédex!
It's a trophy proving you defeated the Single Master in the Battle Subway!
It's a trophy proving you defeated the Double Master in the Battle Subway!
It's a trophy proving you defeated the Multi Master in the Battle Subway!
It's a model of a Ferris wheel Mom bought as a souvenir.
It's a Darumaka Pokémon doll Mom received in the past. When you get knocked down, just get up again!
Hee hee! I came to visit! Professor Juniper is investigating a cave on Route 20!
The Cave of Being... I wonder where those three Pokémon-- Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf--flew off to? Uxie is a Pokémon that symbolizes knowledge... If you mention a place in Unova where knowledge is gathered, the first thing that comes to mind is Nacrene City's museum... Mesprit is the Pokémon that presides over emotion, right? Celestial Tower's bell stirs emotions... And Azelf is willpower... The desire to see something through... What place could represent that?
Route 23's mysterious Pokémon... Just by being near it you can feel some kind of willpower... It's best to go have a look for yourself!
Sometimes, there are mass outbreaks of Pokémon, right? A lot of the exact same Pokémon show up at the same time, and it's such a surprise! Like where were all of you before? If you look at the electronic bulletin boards, you can learn about them!
Professor Juniper--I'm talking about Aurea Juniper, mind you... She's researching the origins of Pokémon! It's interesting! Among the Pokémon that exist now, there were some that have been around from the past and some that were discovered recently. By the way, her dad is researching Pokémon distribution and biology!
Your mom's amazing! It's sweet how she met your dad while working reception at the Pokémon Center. Hee hee! She's taught me a lot!

===============================

It's too bad. If you had a Pokémon with you as well, you could compete with VAR(256, 1) and see who is the better Trainer!
To be honest, I don't want my son to go on a journey. I mean, his goal is... But there is no parent who doesn't wish for his or her child to grow.
It looks like my son found something important. It's all because Pokémon-- and you--were by his side!
Someday you will both go on a journey with your Pokémon, too!
VAR(256, 0)... If VAR(256, 1) loses his way on the path, or in life really, please help him, won't you? He's the kind of person who, well, who lets rage build inside him.
VAR(256, 0)... If VAR(256, 1) loses his way on the path, or in life really, please help him, won't you? He's the kind of person who, well, who lets rage build inside him.

Know what? My big brother told me something. He said to talk to the Liepard inside the Poké Ball lots and lots, like I'm doing, until it remembers me! And to pet it, even if it's just on the outside of the Poké Ball!

Aspertia City is in the corner of the Unova region, so this isn't exactly the big leagues for Pokémon battling. If you go to the center of Unova, there are many Pokémon Trainers you can battle.
I wonder if everyone will change now that we have a Pokémon Gym? I mean, if your friends get good at battling, you'll want to get better also, right?
I haven't battled with my Pokémon, so it's still weak...
I'm going to try battling with my Pokémon... If I don't do anything because I'm afraid it will get hurt, it will never get strong.

Captain: Oh, dear daughter. You split your time between your responsibilities as a Gym Leader and with your band, right? I can do that, too!
Roxie: AAAAAAH! You dim-witted...dense...dumb...daft... dippy...dorky...doltish DOOFUS! Doing double duty isn't the problem! You're causing problems for people! Keeping people from getting where they're going because of sheer selfishness is unforgivable! I've HAD it! I'm going to the Gym!

Roxie: C'mon! Don't get down! You can keep trying while you continue on as captain! As long as you don't cause anyone trouble, I won't get mad. I don't know how the Pokéstar Studios people feel about that, though!
Oh... Did you hear us? Well, it looks like everyone from Team Plasma got away... I don't feel really good about it, but at least they're gone. Oh! There was a lot of ruckus, but you can sail to Castelia City now!

So you think Team Plasma's bad, then?

Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Roost! Roost is a move that can restore HP! Also, if a Flying-type Pokémon uses it, it won't be Flying type during the turn, which means the type matchup will change. A supereffective move will be an ordinary move, or a move that would otherwise have no effect will land on it. It's a quite tricky move.
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Synthesis! Synthesis is a move that can restore HP! When the sunlight is harsh, the Pokémon can restore a lot of HP. But in rain, hail, or a sandstorm, the Pokémon cannot restore HP very much. So, watch out for the weather!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Heal Bell! Heal Bell can heal status conditions of allies. It's a loving move to heal status conditions of all the party Pokémon!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Tailwind! Tailwind doubles the Speed of all party Pokémon the turn the move is used and for the next three turns. If Pokémon can act before their opponents, they can have an upper hand!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Pain Split! Pain Split adds the user's HP to the target's HP, divides it by two, and has the Pokémon share it. Use it when the target's HP is higher than your Pokémon's HP. You can reduce the opponent's HP while recovering your Pokémon's HP.

This is the filming studio! This is where Pokéstar Studios movies are born! Well now, come inside! Mr. Deeoh should be waiting!
Hey, AD! That set is in the way of my film! It's slowing down shooting, so go get it out of the way right now!
Hey, AD! The shape of those clouds in the sky doesn't work with my film at all! It's slowing down shooting, so go get them out of the way right now!
You did it, AD! We got the perfect scene! So now, we have to go back and reshoot all of the others from scratch!
Hey, AD!! This Lillipup's fur is different from what I'd envisioned! Hurry up and bring another Lillipup!
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 0)! I thought you were my AD! A star as big as you can be in one of my films! Would you replace that Lillipup and play the Pokémon's part?
Man... That director's going off again... His films may be pretty good, but there's a fine line between genius and insanity...
Bwoo! Bowoof!
I'm a rookie assistant director. I love movies, but I'm not good at making them yet. The director is really strict, and he's always getting mad at me. But... Working for him is teaching me a lot.
You're a Pokéstar Studios actor as well, right? A single line from an actor can change an entire film! Movie shoots are full of possibilities at Pokéstar Studios!
I'm rehearsing right now. In order to make a good film, doing a lot of work before the shoot is really important!
There's a dressing room inside this trailer. Inside they're doing costume fitting, makeup, and script checks! I just finished changing! I'm going to give it my best today, too!
Special sets and movie props are stored inside! Before VFX became so advanced, we actually had to make a lot of things!
Hey, darling! What are we going to watch today?
C'mon, darling! Let's watch one of VAR(256, 0)'s movies today!
Well now... I'd like to see a love story just like ours!
Hm... What movie to see... VAR(256, 0) is the one who always acts really well, right?
Hello there! How about a portrait of one of Pokéstar Studios' famous stars? Right now... Brycen's is a hot ticket with women and kids. Sabrina's is extremely popular with guys! Huh? I'm afraid we don't carry one of VAR(256, 0).
Good day! How about a portrait of one of Pokéstar Studios' famous stars? Right now... Brycen's is very popular with women and kids. Sabrina's is extremely popular with guys! Huh? We've started stocking portraits of VAR(256, 0) recently, but the sales are nothing to write home about.
Hello there! How about a portrait of one of Pokéstar Studios' famous stars? Right now, the most popular is... VAR(256, 0). There's no doubt about it! Hey, has anyone ever mentioned you look kinda like VAR(256, 0)? I'm really jealous! I wish I resembled a star like that.
Brilliant actors come to Pokéstar Studios from all over the world to make movies! That's why the titles of movies are in so many different languages!
Someday, I'm going to be in pictures, become a famous actor, and buy a mansion! A really big mansion! A huge one!
Oh! It's the star who was in the movie I just watched--VAR(256, 0)! VAR(256, 0), you're a star, so you're living in a mansion, right? A really big one? A huge one?
I hear Pokéstar Studios makes horror films as well. Man, who even watches kids' stuff like that anyway?!
Hey, I know him! He was the guy yelling “Mama!" during the movie with ghosts!
When I look at this from here, I feel like I've become a monster! Roar! Ha ha ha...
Just looking at the posters is exciting! Which movie should I watch today?
Good grief... I've been waiting for three hours... How long does it take to put on makeup anyway?
Not just anybody can take part in filming at Pokéstar Studios. Only Trainers approved by the owner can participate.
The captain of the illustrious guard protecting the star Sabrina is me! I rushed here when I heard she had made a shocking debut as an actress. But recently, I've been interested in a star named VAR(256, 0)!
Recently, films starring VAR(256, 0) are getting a lot of buzz. ...Wait? VAR(256, 0)? I wish I had something for you to sign!
Ciao! Come va? Are you used to Pokéstar Studios yet? The staff here is very international! It's very exciting, isn't it? See you during a shoot someday! Buona giornata!
¡Todos me consideran una niña prodigio de la actuación! ¡Por no hablar de que soy una auténtica estrella! ¡Mi popularidad y mi destreza como actriz están a años luz de ti, principiante!
Excuse me, I'm her manager. What she just said is, “People know me as a brilliant child actress! Not to mention I’m a top star! My popularity and acting skills are way beyond yours, rookie!"
Guten Tag! Since you've come to Pokéstar Studios, we suit actors have been busy. Bis bald!
Hey! It's VAR(256, 0)! C'mon, give me an autograph!
Why, VAR(256, 0)... Let me ask you dis... When will you do me da honor of being in one of my films?
¡Hola! ¿Qué tal? You've become so famous! Even me, the top star in my country, can't compete with you in Unova!
Hey! VAR(256, 0)! Today, Pokéstar Studios is having a special ceremony! Mr. Stu Deeoh is waiting! Come with me, won't you?!
VAR(256, 0), congratulations! Today is a special day for you and for Pokéstar Studios! I treasure the time I've spent acting with you!
Hey, VAR(256, 0)! I'm honored to have been in a movie with you! Me? You don't remember me? You can't be serious! I was the UFO!
If it isn't VAR(256, 0)! You're too much! I'm so moved! Congratulations and everything! I-I'm so glad I was your fan, VAR(256, 0)!
Acting with you... It was pretty fun and a good experience. Coming clear out here was worth it.
I'm proud that I was able to make movies with you! Congratulations, VAR(256, 0)!
How great, VAR(256, 0)! Now listen! I was the director of your debut! So I'm almost like your parent! Don't forget to be grateful!
Hey, boss! We're here!
Hm... VAR(256, 0), today's a day to be remembered. When I built this place, I made a wish and a promise. For the day Pokéstar Studios would grow until it was a temple of entertainment that would amaze the whole world... And for the day that Pokéstar Studios created a new star worthy of it... I wouldn't build anything on this platform. But look... There's a bronze statue here now. In other words, my wish has come true, and I fulfilled my promise. That's right, VAR(256, 0)... It's all thanks to you!
Your acting excites the staff and the other actors... Your acting charms audiences... You're amazing... Better said... You're the best...
VAR(256, 0)! You are the true star of Pokéstar Studios! You're the shooting star across the night sky that is the silver screen!
So that's why we got this small gift for you.
Yessir, boss! OK! VAR(256, 0)! Come this way!

It's filled with movie props for shooting films.

The jumpsuit I'm wearing is an essential part of creating visual effects! It may be cutting-edge technology, but it's pretty embarrassing to wear!
Hey, ya got this, kid? What we mean by VFX is visual effects. It's a technology that lets us use computers to process images. In Pokéstar Studios movies, the effects are really important!
I'm the screenwriter! I write the scripts that become the movie's stories. Feels like my head is packed with nothing but stories.
I'm a big guy, but I work with small movie props. Sometimes I even make the items actors use or the furniture on the sets!
Hello! I'm the cinematographer. Well, put more simply, I'm the cameraman.
Hey there! I'm the audio engineer! My job is doing things like recording the actor's lines. Most of Pokéstar Studios' dialog is dubbed in later, so right now, I have a bit of time on my hands!
C'mon... Where could it be? I'm going to get in trouble again if I can't find that megaphone! Oh, do you work in films? I'm working as the AD. I guess you could call the AD the assistant director.

Heh heh heh... You see, this is the dressing room for an amazing beauty scouted from the something-or-other region. I wonder what's going on inside...
Whaugh! VAR(256, 0)! Thanks as always for your hard work! I'm putting my whole heart and soul into my guard duty and making sure not even a single Joltik will get through.
Only special stars approved by our boss are allowed into this special dressing room. A brat like you has no business here. Scram! Get out of here!
Good day! Mr. Deeoh told me about it! VAR(256, 0), please, enter the dressing room, and relax to your heart's content.
Pokéstar Studios movies are shot using rental Pokémon, right? Does this mean my little Lillipup can't be in the movies?
If you shoot a movie with rental Pokémon once successfully, then you can use your own Pokémon! That's why me and my Stunfisk are shooting for the stars! Right, Stunfisk?
...
Welcome to the soundstage of Pokéstar Studios! Oh... You're... I guess since I don't remember your name, you must be new!
Welcome to the soundstage of Pokéstar Studios! Oh... You're... You've been coming in and out quite a bit recently! Are your movies good? Hee hee! Maybe I should go see one!
Welcome to the soundstage of Pokéstar Studios! Oh... You're... VAR(256, 0), wasn't it? I hear your name around here quite often lately! Tee hee! You're working hard, huh?
Welcome to the soundstage of Pokéstar Studios! Oh... Hello, VAR(256, 0). When we release your films, the whole theater fills up! Tee hee hee! At some point you joined the ranks of the big stars, huh?
Welcome to the soundstage of Pokéstar Studios! Oh... Hello, VAR(256, 0). Tee hee hee... I never would've imagined you would become this famous...
Hi! You're new, right? Listen up! If you're an actor, make sure to check the script! Work hard and try to be a big star like Brycen!
Hey! You're VAR(256, 0), right? I've been hearing your name here and there recently. So apparently they're making scripts with you in mind now, aren't they?
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 0)! You're quite popular now, too! The Pokéstar Studios staff is really proud you're on our team!
I'm the VFX specialist! You've seen those green screens in the soundstage, right? Images filmed in front of them are turned into impressive movies using computers!
Hey! Want to know anything about Pokéstar Studios?
Pokéstar Studios films are shot while following a script! In other words, the script is the foundation the rest of the movie is built on! Directions for making filming work and information about the other actors is also written in the script! You can look at it while shooting, so check it if you're in trouble! The scripts you can shoot increase depending on things like the content of the movies you've made or how much they've grossed!
Pokémon are an indispensable part of moviemaking at Pokéstar Studios! The actor and the Pokémon's acting are what make a shoot proceed. At first we have you rent Pokémon for each different script. Once you can make a good film, you'll be able to shoot it again with your own Pokémon!
The basics of Pokéstar Studios film acting resemble Pokémon battling. But it's not a battle, so winning isn't always important! Hints about what to do are written in the script, so check it carefully. The director's comments can also be helpful!
As the shoot goes on, you can pick lines! Choose the line that makes you think, “This is great!" The lines you choose will change your costars' acting and the story of the final film itself!
As you make movies and they are played in the theater, you'll become popular! If you become popular, I'm sure some good things will happen!
OK! Do your best!

Pokémon 2
At Pokéstar Studios, any Pokémon can participate in the filming! But you need to pay attention to the moves it knows. If a Pokémon knows any of these moves, it can't be in a movie: Transform, Torment, or Metronome. These moves get in your costars' way, so they're banned at Pokéstar Studios. Keep this in mind when filming with your own Pokémon!

Hmmmm... What should I do? I can't possibly manage everything.
Hello there!
Welcome to Join Avenue! We don't have anything yet, as you see, so it's just an avenue at this point. Oh, where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself. I am the owner of Join Avenue. My dream is to go around the world building avenues that bustle with lots of people. The problem is...I have no one I can trust to manage the avenue. ... ... Something just struck me! You seem to be a Trainer traveling around, aren't you? You naturally meet people from all over this region, don't you? I know it seems sudden, but will you manage the avenue for me?
Thank you so much! OK, tell me what kind of a person you are. What would be your favorite phrase that you'd use to greet everyone?
I really need you to help me. You know what that means, don't you?
That's a great line! Then what would you say when something truly moves your heart? You want to choose something universal, a phrase that anyone will understand, you know?
VAR(311, 0) VAR(311, 1) I knew it! You are the one! Who else could be so well suited to managing the avenue?
Oh, I almost forgot.
My assistants! You heard me. I must leave now, so please support our newest manager.
Yes, sir! Please take care of yourself.
Pleased to meet you! How should we address you?
VAR(314, 0)! Now that you are the one to manage the development of the avenue, please turn it into a wonderful attraction where many people visit. I'll explain how to develop the avenue, so please talk to me when you are ready.
VAR(314, 0)! We will explain what you need to know to become truly superior in this role.
To make it more attractive, you'll want useful city improvements. For example...shops! In order for you to make a shop, you'll need someone who has a dream. You then have to “invite" that person to join the avenue. Speaking of invitation, someone is coming this way. Why don't you “invite" that person?
Let's build a shop first. You need to talk to a person in the avenue to “invite" that person so you can have the person build a shop.
Congratulations! You've just made your first shop! But having a shop means nothing if you don't have any customers. You'll need to talk to a customer and “recommend" the shop. Speaking of recommendation, someone is coming this way. Why don't you “recommend" our shop?
Let's “recommend" the shop to someone.
Congratulations! You've just recommended the shop, and that made the popularity of the avenue go up! Raise the popularities of shops and the avenue to make it famous! A good tip for bringing more customers is to use the communication features. You should turn on the C-Gear to attract lots of passersby. You should also try communication facilities, such as the Union Room and the Global Terminal. VAR(314, 0), we'll be serving as your assistants in the room over here. Please come visit us. If you'll excuse us...

VAR(314, 0)! Do you have any questions?
This is the brand-new avenue in the Unova region, VAR(313, 1)! It is still under major development to create an avenue that's perfect for meeting people, making discoveries, and having fun. Good times!
VAR(314, 0), you've been signed up by the owner to manage the avenue. Your goal is simple: create a dazzling, delightful avenue! Design an avenue that will fill all visitors with joy and the desire to visit often. You'll have assistants, so please let us know how we can help you.
You can use various communication features to encourage people to visit. Talk to people during their visits here. There are two things you can do. The first thing is to “invite" someone. The other thing is to “recommend" a shop to someone. To really get the idea of all you can do, stay and listen to a little more about it.
You can bring in more customers by using the communication features. When you have the C-Gear turned on, passersby will visit the avenue. People you've met through the Union Room, Infrared Communication, Random Matchups, and GTS visit the avenue, too. Communication features aren't the only way to bring in visitors. As your adventure progresses, fans might sometimes visit the avenue. You can use your Town Map to check the current number of visitors. It might be fun to check it now and then.
When you select “Invite," the visitor will begin to live here and create a shop. Each person has his or her own hopes and dreams. I recommend listening carefully to the person before you decide.
“Recommend" a shop to a visitor. If the visitor is happy with the shop, the popularity of the shop and this avenue will go up. As their popularity goes up, shops and this avenue reach higher ranks. The higher the shop rank goes up, the more items and services it'll have. When the current avenue rank goes up, item prices will become slightly more reasonable. Try to recommend shops that your visitors will be delighted with so the popularity of the shops goes up!
VAR(314, 0), this is your office. Your assistants and I will support you in developing VAR(313, 1). As the avenue grows bigger and bigger, there will be more and more visitors. You may enjoy hearing what they have to say, so please drop by from time to time.
At Markets, you'll be able to purchase various items useful for your adventure. Sometimes they carry items not available at Poké Marts, or so I've heard.
At Raffle Shops, you can win cool prizes. The grand prize is a Master Ball!
Flower Shops carry Berries. Different shops may have different Berries.
At Nurseries, you can put Pokémon Eggs in incubators to speed up hatching.
Dojos train Pokémon. They can level up Pokémon and raise the base stats of Pokémon. Be aware that Pokémon won't learn certain moves or evolve while they level up this way.
Antique Shops carry rare finds. You may find out you have really rare items when you have them appraised.
Cafés give you and your Pokémon the chance to have a nice meal. Meals make Pokémon happy, and they will grow friendly faster. You can also level Pokémon up and raise their base stats. Be aware that Pokémon won't learn certain moves or evolve while they level up this way.
Beauty Salons keep Pokémon tidy. Haircuts and cosmetics make Pokémon happy, and they grow friendlier faster.
There are seven different kinds of shops that can be built in VAR(313, 0). When someone is invited to build a shop, the type of shop they open is based on that person's hopes and dreams. When you recommend shops to visitors, the shops get more popular and their rank improves. Talk to assistant 2 for advice on what kinds of shops will grow the fastest.
There are eight different kinds of shops you can build in VAR(313, 0). When someone is invited to build a shop, the type of shop they open is based on that person's hopes and dreams. When you recommend shops to visitors, the shops get more popular and their rank improves. Talk to assistant 2 for advice on what kinds of shops will grow the fastest.
Is there anything you'd like to know about shops?
I'm looking forward to seeing this grow into a fantastic avenue!
Bring in more customers by using the communication features. People you've met through communication features will visit the avenue. When you talk to them, there are three things you can choose to do. You can “invite" the person to join the avenue, “recommend" a shop, or “recruit" that person as an assistant. For details, please listen to each explanation.
If you choose to “Recruit," the visitor will become your assistant and help you. Your chances of recruiting the visitor improve if your avenue ranks higher than the person's ideals.

I have a present for you today. I've recruited a new assistant for you.
Today, I want to say how grateful I am. Thank you for doing so much to develop this avenue! You're a truly deserving “VAR(314, 1)"! I'd say you've made the avenue your own! Because of that, you have earned the privilege of renaming the avenue. Please consider a new name for Join Avenue that describes its character.
Wonderful! VAR(314, 1), VAR(313, 2) belongs to you now! I'll leave everything to you. Continue developing the avenue so visitors will be even more delighted.
Today, I have a present for you. Now you can change the avenue's neon arch as you wish. It will give a fresh look to the avenue. Won't it delight our visitors even more?!
I have a piece of advice for you today. You'd want an assistant that suits your preferences, wouldn't you? Why don't you choose one of the visitors? It's quite easy. Talk to a person and choose “Recruit." The higher the current avenue rank is compared to the person's ideals, the better chance you'll have of recruiting him or her successfully. Please bring even more delight to our visitors!
Today, I have a big present for you! To commemorate your entering the Hall of Fame, shops have been renovated. You'll notice new services and items, so you might want to check those out. What's more... Have you heard of Pokémon Eggs? You'll now be able to build what they call a “Nursery," which enables Eggs to be hatched more quickly than normal. Find a visitor who wants to build a Nursery, and give it a try!
Today, I have a surprise for you. Everybody here is celebrating the great effort you've been putting in. What are you waiting for? Don't be shy! Go and greet everyone!
I have a present for you to recognize all your continuous effort. It's just a little something. Please, take it.
Keep up the good work!

First, let's restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center when your Pokémon's HP goes down. If you're planning to travel any distance, you should stock up on Potions at a Poké Mart. Good luck, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy! Good luck and take care!

Brisk walking is a part of Ninja training.
Pokémon battles with my sisters! The more we battle, the more we care about each other!
Hello! Hello! Greetings are important, aren't they?
They say time is money. But when you spend time, you can't get it back. I don't want to regret that.
Every day, the city has more people...
When I work, I do it all out! When I loaf, I do it all out, too!
This city is a sleepless city... But I need to sleep to dream...
I wish there were shoes that recharge energy by walking!
I want to see you soon...
Pokémon Eggs! Pokémon Eggs!
It's your choice to work frantically. It's also your choice to slack off.
Which should I watch, baseball or basketball?
You need to enjoy your work. Otherwise life is boring! Because we spend most of the day at work.
I want to go to Pokéstar Studios.
Have you had a Pokémon battle with the Gym Leader, Burgh? He's a strange one, but he likes Pokémon very much.
I traveled with my Pokémon for the first time in a long time. It was fun!
I will go to the Hoenn region for business.
People from all over the world gather here in Castelia City. This city is like a little world map!
Castelia, Nimbasa, Nimbasa, Castelia...
Even in the crowd of people, don't lose sight of yourself!
Every day, everybody goes their own way.
My business card has a picture of the Pokémon I like best.
I always walk here, so I can walk even with my eyes closed!
I'll turn an old subway train into a habitat for fish Pokémon!
Hey, hey, kid! It's dangerous!
Will you become a motorbike rider when you grow up?
The night wind is piercing right through me... My motorbike is freezing, too...
Zowieee!
Wooooo!
Is that so?
Yes.
Huh?
Oh, no!
What's up?
Sorry.
Bye-bye!
I love you!
Twinkle!
Wait!
How is it?
Hello!

Forest paths were created by the Pokémon that often walk there. If you walk the paths, sometimes you can feel like a Pokémon yourself.

Cheren: Hey, nice timing! I heard that Team Plasma was seen in Pinwheel Forest... Could you help me look for them?
We don't know how many there are, so splitting up doesn't seem like a very good tactic. Got it! I'll wait here until you're ready to go!
Thank you! This is a good opportunity for me to see up close what you can really do. I suppose I'll follow your lead. Leave recovery to me!
Cheren: Stop! If you go past here, we'll leave the Pinwheel Forest. We still haven't found Team Plasma, but do you need to leave for a minute?
Cheren: Team Plasma was seen inside Pinwheel Forest... But you already know that. Will you help me look for them?
People and Pokémon each have their own strengths-- the strength to realize dreams, and the strength to protect others... I'm sure N understands that now.
Team Plasma... Or better said, Ghetsis... It's almost like, to him, there was nothing else in the world but himself...
My ideal is to be strong... But there are many ways to be strong in this world. Simply winning battles doesn't help me find the ideal strength I desire.
You remind me of a friend of mine whose strength was amazing. I wonder what that friend is up to these days...
Still no sign of Team Plasma. Why don't we head deeper into the forest?
                                                                                            
                                                                            
Gorm: Boo!
I am Gorm. I was once one of Team Plasma's Seven Sages.
Cheren: Team Plasma's finished. Despite that, you still haven't given up? Are you here planning something?
Gorm: Wait one moment! I have no plans to confront you. I don't mean to disappoint you, but I doubt I'm a match for either of you in the first place... Hm? What happened to your glasses? Excuse me, but that's not important. I learned of my old ally's recklessness, and I had come here to admonish him... But the matter had already been resolved, and this place made me think... What did we believe in that made us try to steal the Dragon Skull?
A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct it is committing another mistake. Do you understand what this means? Avoiding all mistakes is impossible, but not fixing mistakes you've made-- that is truly foolish. That being said, this doesn't really concern you, does it? Well then, Trainers, may you and your Pokémon be well.
Cheren: You know... If it wasn't for Ghetsis, he might've chosen another path... Or maybe not. He was the one who decided to follow Ghetsis, after all...
That aside, thank you! Your help made this investigation go smoothly. This is my thanks! Come on, just take it!
OK! Be seeing you!
I'm going to do a lap around Unova clockwise from Nimbasa City without healing my Pokémon! It's the Unova Spartan Marathon, and next time, I'm going to race!
We're thinning trees to protect the forest. That's why we're having Pokémon cut down trees. When there are too many trees, the whole forest gets weaker... These trees are being cut down so the whole forest will thrive...
Ah, wouldn't it be nice if the Pokémon living in the forest liked the sunbeams filtering through the leaves, too!
Hi, Trainer. If you have a Pokédex, could you show me your Habitat List? I want to know about the Pokémon that live in Pinwheel Forest.
You still have many meetings waiting for you... Tell me when you've encountered all of the Pokémon in Pinwheel Forest.
Perfect! This is my thanks!
Finding the Pokémon that can only be found in the rustling grass is really amazing!
The legendary Pokémon... Is it true it was really beyond here?
The surface is covered with moss. Touching it feels good somehow.
Trainer Tips!  A forest is likely to contain many well-hidden items! They may be hard to find, so look carefully!

This happened around when the hero appeared in Opelucid City with the legendary dragon Pokémon.
Right around here, you would hear a very sad cry. Then a bright-green Pokémon would run around like the wind.
I've heard it's called Virizion, and it took up against humans to protect Pokémon from a war between people. It's apparently a legendary Pokémon. Maybe it was afraid that Team Plasma's rising to power would ruin the world and its friends' homes would be destroyed.

The Desert Resort is vast, and the Pokémon here are strong! It's an ideal place to test your skills!
Go through the gate, and just head straight. That's how you get to the Relic Castle.
Desert Resort Ahead It's nicer than the average desert!

===============================

I came clear out to the Desert Resort to train, but... It would be so much easier to proceed if I had a Water-type Pokémon...
You're the second person to come clear out here to talk to me! I'm so moved! So, I'll give you this!
If a Pokémon holds this Soft Sand, the power of its Ground-type moves goes up!
According to what I've heard, that Relic Castle is the ruins of a city built by the hero of old and the dragon Pokémon that accompanied the hero.
Oh! A sea of sand! I don't need Go-Goggles here! The Mirage Tower in a desert of the Hoenn region has disappeared. Unova's desert is also swallowing up the Relic Castle little by little.
An expansive desert and a castle buried in sand! There's no doubt about it! Treasure is here! It's been a year since the day my internal treasure detector went off, but I still haven't found any yet. I'm still following my dream, though... And I'm having so much fun I can barely stand it!
The Funfest Mission “VAR(320, 0)" has been added to the Entralink!
Spending each day living my dream... Is THAT my treasure?!

The Relic Castle in the Desert Resort. You can tell just by looking at it that time has been cruel.
I'm a School Kid, and I'll tell you this. Just like in caves, you can run into Pokémon almost anywhere in the desert. But they don't like hiding in the pale sand. So if you walk there, you won't have to worry about battling.

Clay: Here we are!
Whaddya think? Great buildin', huh? Here's where the Pokémon World Tournament takes place! Ain't she purty? Follow me, tads!
Cheren: I barely recognized you and VAR(256, 0). You two are way different from when we battled in Aspertia City! Traveling with Pokémon makes everyone grow so much...
VAR(256, 1): What was that just now?!
I'm going after him! VAR(256, 0), come with me!
Stop.
Colress: There's no reason for you to stick your necks into something so dangerous!
VAR(256, 1): The Pokémon I'm looking for--my little sister's Purrloin--it might be with them!
Cheren: I'm going, too! I've got his back!
Colress: I don't understand. That's not courage, it's recklessness! Does he think anything is possible simply because he has Pokémon with him? No, no... That's not possible. All Trainers and Pokémon are bound to one another by Poké Balls... Then maybe it is this bond that will allow Trainers to overcome the impossible if they trust their partner Pokémon.
Colress: Trust... It's too much of an unknown factor. But if believing in your Pokémon gives you the courage to stand up to Team Plasma... And the courage to help your friends... Then follow them south to the dock!
VAR(256, 1): The Shadow Triad? What's their deal, anyway! AAAAH! Team Plasma! Where did you vanish to!
Cheren: The Shadow Triad... With their superhuman powers, they can immobilize people and then disappear! But I'm more concerned with what Zinzolin said... “Once again, we will use the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon and we will rule the Unova region!" What could that mean? The legendary Dragon-type Pokémon Reshiram and Zekrom aren't in Unova anymore...
VAR(256, 0). There's something I want to look into, so I'm going to head to Route 6! Be careful out there!
A helmet is an important tool for shock protection! It's good to let your Pokémon have one, too!
If you let a Pokémon hold a Rocky Helmet, the foe will also be damaged if that foe's move makes physical contact.
       
Water Pledge, Fire Pledge, and Grass Pledge. When combinations of these three moves are used in battle, special things happen!
       
       
       
My husband can teach some Pokémon the ultimate moves! I'll tell you their names. The blazing Fire-type Pokémon: Charizard, Typhlosion, Blaziken, Infernape, and Emboar! The restless Water-type Pokémon: Blastoise, Feraligatr, Swampert, Empoleon, and Samurott! The quiet Grass-type Pokémon: Venusaur, Meganium, Sceptile, Torterra, and Serperior!
What kind of Trainers will come? What kind of battle will it be?
When battling in front of people, it's well known that you should stand your ground and not dance around. But I can't resist moves that groove, like Petal Dance, Quiver Dance, Fiery Dance, and Dragon Dance. And on rare occasions, even Lunar Dance!
The crowd will go wild for my Pokémon!
Isn't it wonderful how people challenging themselves helps bring the world together!
When a Pokémon learns the move Hidden Power, somehow I can tell what type that move will be! Should I tell you what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn?
Now that I'm aware of my hidden power, I can tell you what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn! Do you want to know?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power, the move's type would be VAR(259, 0)!
The type of this Pokémon's Hidden Power is VAR(259, 0)!
If you want to know, ask me, and I'll activate my hidden power for you!
It's not possible for an Egg to use Hidden Power!
I'm sorry, but this Pokémon can't learn to use Hidden Power.
That cave down there is the Relic Passage! It was recently discovered, but amazingly, it's... Wait? Where was it connected to again?
A ship's only really a ship when it's crossing an ocean. Docked ships sure look lonely.

Cheren: Why did you call me, too? I'm busy looking into something!
Clay: Ya know somethin', Cheren. The one who's gotta show everyone what Pokémon battlin' means--is you. And yer pal ain't here, either! I'm countin' on the power of youth, 'cause everyone likes up-and-comin' stars! OK! Whenever yer ready, get on over to reception!
Clay: Whenever yer ready, get on over to reception!
Cheren: Man oh man... You never change, Clay. But the tournament itself does look pretty fun! OK! I'll go register!
VAR(256, 1): Me, too!
VAR(256, 0). C'mon! Let's have some fun. We'll battle, plain and simple!
Clay: An outstandin' battle, runts! Now everybody's gonna want to join in on this here tournament an' show their stuff!
Roxie: Hey! You two! Haven't you got any wild and crazy Pokémon battles to show me?! Guess I'll have to enter the tournament myself and rock the audience right outta their seats!
Clay: See what I mean? People are pourin' in already! If the strongest Trainers from all over join in, it'll raise up everybody's level of skill! An' then, li'l ol' Driftveil City will grow even more and make a heap of money! So keep on bustin' those battles and rilin' everybody up! See ya!
Colress: By having battles with many Trainers, I can bring out Pokémon's abilities! Eventually, as I continue to battle, the truth of my theory will be evident to all!
VAR(256, 1): Aww... I wanted to win the tournament the first time I participated!
Cheren: The Unova Gym Leaders will probably participate in order to improve their skills.
Someday, I'll be a famous guy! But for now, I'm just a spectator here.
Many Trainers from far away will come to participate!
Clay is awesome! I heard he started all this to encourage Driftveil City's development!
Two years ago, this was the Cold Storage area!
That's the Pokémon World Tournament for you! It's packed with spectators!
It's crazy popular! This is what packed to the rafters means!
What can I do when everything's sold out?
It's the Pokémon World Tournament! It's all in the name! Trainers have gathered from all over the world!
Hello there, Trainer. Let me fill you in about Battle Points. Battle Points, also known as BP, are points you get for winning streaks in either Nimbasa City's Battle Subway or this tournament. Win a lot, save up lots of points, and you can exchange them for useful items!

Hi there!
Bianca: Did you know this? If you push the floating stones, they move!
As always, this place is charged with lots of electricity that Pokémon like! The electric charges react from one stone to another, so that's why there are floating stones! You can't push all of them, though.
Oh, that's right! I came here to research something! Be seeing you!
Bianca: The bridge fell apart, but it's being fixed right now!
What could have happened? Maybe wild Pokémon ran into it. At any rate, it's going to take some time to fix. Go wait around Driftveil!

VAR(256, 0)! Oh, I see! So, you travel all around like this and toughen yourself up, then.
Well, I suppose you have many battles ahead of you. Pokémon battles as a Pokémon Trainer. Battles about how you should live your life... You'll lose sometimes, but I think what matters is that you do things your own way. If you surpass what you've done before, you have bested yourself.
Well then. I'll be waiting for your challenge at the Pokémon League!

Cedric Juniper: Two years ago... On the top floor of this tower... One lone man faced a legendary Pokémon. His name was N. He sought Reshiram in order to understand the meaning of truth. I wonder if he succeeded in finding his own truth.
We still don't know anything about it. Could the Dragonspiral Tower somehow symbolize ideals? Could it somehow represent truth?
Cedric Juniper: So you came here as well!
It was two years ago... In this tower, a certain man and a certain Pokémon came face-to-face. This man pursued his ideals so he could change the world.
It was two years ago... In this tower, a certain man and a certain Pokémon came face-to-face. This man sought the truth so he could change the world.
That's right. This building rising serenely into the sky is the Dragonspiral Tower. It has towered over this land since before Unova was founded. On the highest floor, the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon was waiting for the appearance of a person seeking his or her ideals... It was exactly how the legends said it would be...

Ah! The Dark Stone! If that's the case, you must be headed to the top floor. Changing the world... That's an outrageous idea, but it is possible to change yourself. ...As long as you pursue your ideals.
Ah! The Light Stone! If that's the case, you must be headed to the top floor. Changing the world... That's an outrageous idea, but it is possible to change yourself. ...As long as you seek the truth.
My! That conversation sure took a serious turn! Maybe something light and sweet would help balance things out!

How long does “wait until everyone else arrives" mean, exactly?
The area past here is important! The people heading to Route 21 are definitely important, but we have an important role as well!
VAR(256, 1): You're already here, huh? Anyone who tries to block us will go running away with their tail between their legs!
Hey, it's good! We're all set here!
It's finally time! C'mon! Let's go!
VAR(256, 1): You're all alone now... So, which one of us are you gonna tackle?
Oi! It's me! Me! The ex-Team Plasma guy! The one Rood asked to be a spy!
VAR(256, 1): Oh, yeah... I remember you. Being ex-Team Plasma is really rough, eh?
You know, N was so nice to Pokémon... And all I wanted to do was protect Pokémon from bad people...
VAR(256, 1): Well, I suppose... If we don't crush Team Plasma, then guys like you and that N guy will always be treated like villains. OK! I'm outta here, VAR(256, 0)!
Oh, thank you. That's so nice. Even if we said it was for Pokémon, in the end, we were doing what we wanted to do. Please excuse me. There's still something I have to do!
We're standing watch here so our allies don't go AWOL!
None shall pass! Sages' orders!

Rood: Oh! You're safe! I'm so glad! As for Team Plasma's ship, a man in a white lab coat appeared. He said that a Trainer had given him the answer he'd been seeking, and, as thanks, he would disband Team Plasma... Then he said, “Farewell! Walk a just path with Pokémon!" and he flew the ship away. So everything has been resolved. We were even able to confirm that Lord N is safe.
I'm in no position to say anything. In the past, I stole Pokémon, too.
I wonder if that guy who ran off had figured something out...

===============================
Text File: 292
===============================
VAR(256, 1): Come here.
Wait a sec. He said he wants to talk to them so his old allies won't get hurt.
Rood: Aah! I will say it as many times as it takes until you understand! Ghetsis's real plan was to take over the Unova region! Liberating Pokémon was nothing more than an excuse! If anything, it would've made Pokémon suffer!
Team Plasma: Uh-huh, yeah. That's a pretty speech, gramps! You fool! We're not going to listen to what a traitor has to say!
VAR(256, 1): Well, that didn't work...
VAR(256, 1): Hey!
Let me through!
Team Plasma: What are you saying? Looking to get hurt?
VAR(256, 1): I'm going to get a stolen Pokémon back! I'm not gonna listen to villains like you!
Rood! Ex-Team Plasma! Why do you have Pokémon by your sides?
To protect what's important to you, right? Even if your precious Pokémon get hurt, even if your ideals are damaged, the time to fight is NOW!
Team Plasma: You're just a kid! Quit trying to act so cool! Whatever! Nobody's getting close to the Plasma Frigate! Wipe them ALL out!
VAR(256, 1): VAR(256, 0)! As usual, take the other one!
Team Plasma: Like he said! We're going to crush you along with the traitors! Because Team Plasma exists to cause trouble!
Rood: Are your Pokémon OK? You should take these with you!
You, too.
VAR(256, 1): Thanks...
I'm passing through! Oh, it looks like their backup has arrived.
Rood: At times like these, those whose hearts weaken, those whose determination falters, can accomplish nothing! To save our old allies, to protect Unova, we will fight!
Both of you, go! No, just a moment... VAR(256, 1), was it? About the Pokémon you're looking for... In all likelihood, it is in the possession of the Shadow Triad--the dark warriors who appear silently.
VAR(256, 1): Got it! If I rescue it, that helps you guys absolve your guilt, doesn't it? Guess I'll help you out!
Rood: At that time, I believed we were on the side of justice. By serving my king, N, I was going to make a world without war. But I was conceited, and I couldn't see the unhappiness we were causing. That's why I can't let it happen again!
Don't ignore Pokémon's feelings and separate them from their Trainers!
Is this where you come to an understanding by trading blows? This is what being young is, right?
That traitorous Sage! I'm going to pound him into a pulp!
We're going to conquer Unova and make all the Pokémon ours! Then our failure two years ago won't matter anymore!
Oh! I can feel how strongly this person feels! I-it's making me doubt myself!
I don't care about you at all! 'Cause you can't beat our boss! I'll stay here and pound these traitors!
We're gonna freeze Unova solid and steal everyone's Pokémon!
That's what I would expect from someone who binds their Pokémon with Poké Balls!
What you're doing now is nothing more than a futile struggle!

But I'll forgive you for that as well. Zekrom, which you were kind enough to bring with you, can shatter ice! Now you've saved me the work of searching for it! Well, actually, I knew you'd appear if we fired ice missiles into Opelucid City and you noticed the change!

Come now, Trainer. This time no one will save you! But to make things interesting, I'll give you a chance. Let's see if you can stop THIS Kyurem!
What's this? Your Poké Balls are trembling. Could your Pokémon be shaking with rage?
No! That's not possible! Simple tools don't have emotion or thought! Come! Challenge Kyurem! Just so you know, catching it is impossible! My cane emits signals that disrupt the function of all Poké Balls!

Kyurem vanished into the darkness of the cave...
It's the cane Ghetsis was holding. Was he controlling Kyurem with it?
Cheren: VAR(256, 0)! That was Kyurem just now, right? So that's the legendary Pokémon Team Plasma, or should I say Ghetsis, was using...
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), you're amazing! You've met so many Pokémon!
Hey now! Your Pokédex should be pretty full, right? I'm sure Professor Juniper will be really happy if you show her!
You showed Professor Juniper your Pokédex, didn't you? She told me about how happy she was!
Cheren: I'm sure she was! In Unova, actually in the whole world, there are still many Pokémon that are waiting to meet you, though!
Bianca: Still... How many Pokémon could there be in all? I think I'll go back to Nuvema Town and ask Professor Juniper!
Team Plasma's ship flew away... Is it over?
I see... So it's finally over. More importantly, you rescued Kyurem from Team Plasma, right? You're really something!
I suppose... You have to be the one who decides when it's over. More importantly, you rescued Kyurem from Team Plasma, right? You're really something!
I'm...gonna make sure Purrloin gets back to my sister! Still can't take it out of the Poké Ball yet, though...
What are you gonna do? ... ... He said go to the Pokémon League? That's a good idea! I mean, now you're the strongest in Unova, right? Go prove it!
Do you remember where we first met up in the Giant Chasm? If you follow the path from there, it goes out onto Route 23. Victory Road and the Pokémon League are just past there!

Team Plasma: What? Don't treat us like villains! And don't interfere with our plans to liberate Pokémon!
VAR(256, 1): Liberate? Ha! You're just ordinary Pokémon thieves! And what's more, you use those stolen Pokémon like they're tools!
Team Plasma: Shaddap! Hand over your Pokémon!
VAR(256, 1): Let's do this, VAR(256, 0)!
Team Plasma: They're really tough! But whatever! We've got the Pokémon we need! Now, we flee!
VAR(256, 1): Tch! They run away like Patrat! OK! Let's go farther inside! There might be more in there!
???: I don't think that's necessary, you two.
VAR(256, 1): Could you be Gym Leader Burgh?
Burgh: Yessir! One and the same! I'm Burgh. And there was no one suspicious beyond here!
VAR(256, 1): Is that...so?
Burgh: Yes indeedy! I'm concerned about Team Plasma as well. More importantly, shall we leave this place? For some reason, this sewer is bugging me.
VAR(256, 1): Huh... Didn't you and the other Gym Leaders fight Team Plasma two years ago?
VAR(256, 1): Thanks for your help. Here, use this!
I'll find those other Team Plasma punks! I... I'll never forgive Pokémon thieves! No way!
Burgh: He's gone...
???: You there!
That was an excellent demonstration of battling. The way you brought out the power of your Pokémon against an opponent like Team Plasma... Astounding. Simply astounding. Interesting as well. I see...
Burgh: Who...was that?
Well. No matter. What are you going to do? You can stay here and train your Pokémon. Or maybe you should come challenge me, the Gym Leader! Be seeing you!
Waitasecond! I dropped something here! Just wait until I find it!
Waitasecond! I dropped something here! Just wait until I find it!

Do you want to go back to Castelia City?
We are just about to leave, so please get on board and wait a moment.
Just come talk to me when you want to return to Castelia City!
Somehow, coming here gives me power!
Have you heard about this? A rich person was protecting a Pokémon from bad people here!
Have you heard about this? A rich person was protecting a Pokémon from bad people here!
I wonder how the Pokémon felt while it was in that room... It must have been lonely for a long time.
The Victory Pokémon, Victini... They say it can give its Trainer incredible power. I wonder who has access to that power now...
Th...that... Your Pokémon... Is that the Victory Pokémon, Victini?! Is it true? Have you just kept winning and winning with Victini's help? I wish I had your luck...
Pokémon follow their Trainers' orders without question. And yet, some people try to make Pokémon do bad things!
Nowadays, there aren't as many tourists visiting here. It's boring... But if the alternative is guys like Team Plasma, I'm OK with being bored!
Two hundred years ago, an ultra-rich family bought this island. They named it Liberty Garden.  It's a place where people and Pokémon can live freely.
Dock 2 To board the tour boat, go to Dock 1.
This lighthouse shines with the light of freedom. Only authorized personnel may enter.
Professor Juniper: Oh? Victini!
Professor Juniper: Oh? Your Pokédex... You've caught Victini!
Professor Juniper: Oh? Your Pokédex... You've seen Victini!
In the Unova Pokédex, Victini was assigned a special number: zero. I've heard the special number was assigned in the hope that Victini's power to bring victory would be shared with the Trainer who travels with this Pokédex...
How do you relate to Pokémon? As you fill your Pokédex, you'll find your own answer. That's what I'm hoping for. See you!

Oh, it's just a kid...
You... It couldn't be... The fact that you are here means you came to learn about the secret of Genesect!
We, Team Plasma, revived Genesect from a Fossil. Then we enhanced the Pokémon with the power of science!
It is the strongest Pokémon in history!!
But, our lord N was not interested in this Genesect that was modified by the power of science!
“Science damages the natural beauty of Pokémon! They're perfect beings!"
That's what he said... So our research was halted, and this facility was closed...
However!! The Genesect research is all mine! So if you want to know Genesect's secret, you'll have to beat me in battle!
Battle the Scientist?
I've lost everything... I forgot my duty as a Scientist is to make the world happy. So, this must be what I get for trying to make a Pokémon into a tool for fighting...
I'm going to wash my hands of this Genesect matter... I don't need this anymore... I'll give it to you.
There was another one in my other pocket...
The item I just gave you was made for Genesect. When it holds an item like this, it changes the type of the move called Techno Blast, so it can always have an advantage.
There sure are some very cowardly Trainers, aren't there!
So you want to battle me?!
I've given you all of the Drives. Use them how you wish...
There is a memo stuck to the side of the monitor. Read it?
“My lord N apparently rejected my research... But my research is necessary for Team Plasma to reach its goal... The strongest Pokémon..." The rest of the memo is torn and impossible to read.

Meet lots of Pokémon! Floccesy Ranch, just off Floccesy Town

Text File: 315

VAR(256, 1): Oh! Nice! You've come here to toughen up! All right! Let's see how much stronger you've become! Come at me!
VAR(256, 1): Not bad... You're thinking about how to bring out your Pokémon's strength. I should be able to count on you for backup! What are you doing here anyway? Huh? A Town Map?
VAR(256, 0) handed over the Town Map!
VAR(256, 1): Tch... She didn't have to do that... Thanks to you, too. We just left, and you've already helped me out.
???: I thought it was lively around here! You were having a Pokémon battle, huh? Isn't it nice to be young!
VAR(256, 1): Who are you?
???: Who am I? I'm the owner of this ranch! And this is my wife!
Wife: After a Pokémon battle, you should heal your Pokémon's HP, right? Here, I'll give you this!
And one for you!
It's nice to have Potions when you're far away from a Pokémon Center.
Owner: By the way, you didn't happen to see a Herdier around here, did you? I can't figure out where it went. Our two Herdier are always together and this is the first time one has wandered off, so I'm a little worried...
VAR(256, 1): You're a little worried? Are you KIDDING me?! Your Pokémon might be lost forever! Whatever! I'll look! VAR(256, 0)! Help out!
Owner: Why did he get so mad? I think it's probably just playing somewhere in the ranch.
Wife: I wonder... By the way, dear, if your Pokémon get hurt, let me know. I'll make them feel better for you!
Herdier, where did you go?
VAR(256, 1): Did Herdier... wander somewhere back here? Let's have a look!
Wow, this ranch is really big!
Why haven't we found it yet? I'm worried about Herdier...
Oh! Here! I'll share something good with you!
If your Pokémon is paralyzed, use one of these on it!
Still, Pokémon don't just wander off on their own. In a worst-case scenario, it might be involved in some trouble!
Yawrp!
Did you hear that just now?
I'll check this area! You go deeper in the grove and look!
Look deeper in the grove!
Herdier: Yaarrrp...
VAR(256, 1): That cry! You found it! What a relief! OK, I'll go call its Trainer, so you stay here with it!
???: Tch... You little pest! I'm a member of a group that strikes fear into the hearts of those who stand before it: Team Plasma! Ever heard of it?
That's right! We're the righteous group that tried to conquer Unova two years back in order to liberate Pokémon!
Really? We're the righteous group that tried to conquer Unova two years back in order to liberate Pokémon!
Whatever... Fools will never understand us... Still... First I got lost chasing Herdier... and now some nosy kid caught me! All of this is your fault! Take this!
OK! I'll use this opportunity to retreat for now!
Yap! Bwoof!
Owner: Herdier! What made you come all the way back here? Well, at any rate, I'm really grateful for your help, you two!
VAR(256, 1): You're awfully calm about this! Your Pokémon might have been gone for good! Take better care of it!
Owner: Hmm... I wonder if something happened to him... It's like he's afraid of losing Pokémon... Come on, Herdier! Everyone's waiting! Let's go home!
Owner: Thanks! It's all thanks to you and your Pokémon! You're really great! Hey, is that it? Did Alder train you?
This ranch started when a fence was made to protect Pokémon!
Owner: It is strange for Herdier to wander off on its own. It always plays with the other one or works on the ranch...
Yup! You and your Pokémon are full of energy!
You and your Pokémon look a little worn out... Rest here a minute--you won't get anywhere all tired like that!
You and your Pokémon found Herdier! Great!
Herdier: Bawoo...
Bawoof! Ba woof!
Ba woof! Bawoof!
Baaah!
Baa!
Baawn!
Baa baa!
Baa haa!

Oh! Seriously? You must be kidding. Usually people are happy to trade!
See? It's a good deal, isn't it? We can trade again tomorrow if you want!

Hey there, Trainer! It looks like you've got energetic Pokémon there with ya! Can I ask a favor? I need to get the Workers in this complex fired up! How about it? Help a guy out, will ya?
Yeah! That's what I like to hear! There are some new Workers here in the complex! Go get those three raring to go!
Really? Nobody really wants anything enough anymore!
OK! The three new Workers are in different parts of the complex!
Hey! Ya did it, didn't ya! This is a token of my thanks!
The complex is lively, because everyone is so fired up and ready to go!
Working at this complex was my dream... But now that it's come true, I've got everything I want...
Working at this complex was my dream... But now that it's come true, I've got everything I want... What? The foreman said so? OK, fine. We just have to battle, right?
I came to this complex so my Pokémon could accomplish a lot! That means that as a Trainer, I have to work like crazy!
I'm happy just to be with my awesome Pokémon!
I'm happy just to be with my awesome Pokémon! What? A battle? I guess so... I'll play a bit.
I completely forgot! If I don't work really hard, my Pokémon won't have a chance to shine! All riiight! Time to get to work!
Every day is the same...
Every day is the same... I get bored when things don't change, so I don't mind battling you!
It's OK if every day's the same when I'm working at this complex! It means there aren't any problems!
Heating crude oil separates it into many different components... That's what this distillation tower is for! It's also known as a topper, but I want to call it a distillation tower.
Oh! My knowledge overflowed, and it was overheard!
The smokestacks of the complex rise up into the sky. That powerful silhouette is sure breathtaking, isn't it? By the way, they're burning up waste gas. Recently, they've found all sorts of uses for this gas, though.
Oh! You overheard some of my vast stock of knowledge!
Those gas holders are sure an expression of harmony, aren't they? There's a reason behind that shape. A sphere is best for withstanding the tremendous pressure inside. It would be nice if they would draw a Pokémon on these gas holders, too.
Oh! You overheard some of my breathtaking knowledge. Are you actually...interested in what I have to say? That would mean I have a complex buddy! That makes me really happy! Well then, take this with you!
I know a lot about the complex, right? I was even scouted by the foreman, but I'm happy just looking at it!
Oh my! Why, you have a Pokédex, don't you? I heard that the newest Pokédex has an amazing function called the Habitat List! Could you use it to show me what kind of Pokémon live in this complex?
Oh? You don't have the Habitat List for the complex filled up yet...
Amazing! The Habitat List is filled up! So amazing! There are so many Pokémon living in this complex! Here, take these as thanks!
If you fill up the Habitat Lists, you might complete the Pokédex before you know it!

Bianca: Hi there, VAR(256, 0)!
Um, you know what? There's something I want to investigate here in Reversal Mountain. But the wild Pokémon here are really tough, and I'm having trouble with them! Could you come with me? Please?
Oh! Don't worry! I'll take care of healing our Pokémon, OK? Ready? Let's go!
Oh! VAR(256, 0)! Here! This is the place! Let's look around a little!
Oh! VAR(256, 0)! Here! This is the place! Let's look around a little!
Know what? I didn't know what I was capable of, so I left on a journey to find out!
I'm... Well, I'm not the toughest Trainer. But I was able to continue my journey because my Pokémon worked so hard for me.
Trying to keep winning against everyone is really hard... But it's easy to keep loving Pokémon, and that makes it all worthwhile.
I always want to know more about the Pokémon I like! That's why I started working as Professor Juniper's assistant!
Actually, I'm not sure being a professor's assistant is really what I want to do... But when I do the work, I have lots and lots of fun!
                              
                                
Oh! I want to do a little more looking around. Want to split up for now?
OK, then! I want to do a little more research about where Heatran might be! Thank you for coming with me! Be careful on the rest of your journey!
Oh, OK! I want to do a little more investigating about Heatran. Heatran is a very rarely seen Pokémon, so if I find out more about it, Professor Juniper will be really happy! Thanks for helping me! Be careful on your journey!
OK! Then let's do a little more looking around!
Reversal Mountain... I wonder... Could a Magma Stone be in there? Have you heard of it? They say a Magma Stone was found in a volcano in the distant Sinnoh region. Apparently, it had something to do with Heatran!
There's still something I want to look for in Reversal Mountain. Come with me! Don't worry. I'll take care of healing our Pokémon, OK? OK, here we go!
You strike me as the type who fills out the Habitat List! C'mon, tell me what kind of Pokémon live in Reversal Mountain!
Oh... Still looking into it, huh? Some of the Pokémon are on the outside of Reversal Mountain as well.
Huh! That's amazing. So these Pokémon live here, then! Thanks for showing me something good! Let me pay you back with this!
False Swipe leaves a Pokémon with 1 HP when it would have fainted. It's a very restrained move. It's a great TM to use for catching Pokémon and filling out the Habitat List!

What is this place? It feels very strange. Could this be the place where Reversal Mountain started from--the lair of the Pokémon Heatran?
Heatran is a Pokémon with magma-like blood flowing through it!
The Magma Stone is reacting to something... Will you set it down here?
Gwogobo gwobobobo!
Heatran vanished into the depths of the volcano...

Oh! Undella Town is right through here! I want to keep looking around a bit more. What do you want to do? Should we say bye for now?
OK, then! I want to do a little more research about Heatran anyway! Thank you for coming with me! Be careful on the rest of your journey!
OK, then! I want to do a little more research about where Heatran might be! Thank you for coming with me! Be careful on the rest of your journey!
OK! Then, let's look around a bit more!
Reversal Mountain... I wonder... Could a Magma Stone be in there? Have you heard of it? They say a Magma Stone was found in a volcano in the distant Sinnoh region. Apparently, it had something to do with Heatran!

Bianca: Heeey! VAR(256, 0)!
Bianca: Hi there, VAR(256, 0)!
Um, you know what? There's something I want to investigate here in Reversal Mountain. But the wild Pokémon here are really tough, and I'm having trouble with them! Could you come with me? Please?
Oh! Don't worry! I'll take care of healing our Pokémon, OK? Ready? Let's go!
Oh! VAR(256, 0)! Here! This is the place! Let's look around a little!
Oh! VAR(256, 0)! Here! This is the place! Let's look around a little!
Know what? I didn't know what I was capable of, so I left on a journey to find out!
I'm... Well, I'm not the toughest Trainer. But I was able to continue my journey because my Pokémon worked so hard for me.
Trying to keep winning against everyone is really hard... But it's easy to keep loving Pokémon, and that makes it all worthwhile.
I always want to know more about the Pokémon I like! That's why I started working as Professor Juniper's assistant!
Actually, I'm not sure being a professor's assistant is really what I want to do... But when I do the work, I have lots and lots of fun!
                              
                                
Oh! I want to do a little more looking around. Want to split up for now?
OK, then! I want to do a little more research about where Heatran might be! Thank you for coming with me! Be careful on the rest of your journey!
Oh, OK! I want to do a little more investigating about Heatran. Heatran is a very rarely seen Pokémon, so if I find out more about it, Professor Juniper will be really happy! Thanks for helping me! Be careful on your journey!
OK! Then let's do a little more looking around!
Reversal Mountain... I wonder... Could a Magma Stone be in there? Have you heard of it? They say a Magma Stone was found in a volcano in the distant Sinnoh region. Apparently, it had something to do with Heatran!
There's still something I want to look for in Reversal Mountain. Come with me! Don't worry. I'll take care of healing our Pokémon, OK? OK, here we go!
You strike me as the type who fills out the Habitat List! C'mon, tell me what kind of Pokémon live in Reversal Mountain!
Oh... Still looking into it, huh? Some of the Pokémon are on the outside of Reversal Mountain as well.
Huh! That's amazing. So these Pokémon live here, then! Thanks for showing me something good! Let me pay you back with this!
False Swipe leaves a Pokémon with 1 HP when it would have fainted. It's a very restrained move. It's a great TM to use for catching Pokémon and filling out the Habitat List!

What is this place? It feels very strange. Could this be the place where Reversal Mountain started from-- the lair of the Pokémon Heatran?
Heatran is a Pokémon with magma-like blood flowing through it!
The Magma Stone is reacting to something... Will you set it down here?
Gwogobo gwobobobo!
Heatran vanished into the depths of the volcano...

There is a Pokémon called Cresselia in the far Sinnoh region. Its wings shine like the crescent moon and keep nightmares away.
There is a Pokémon called Darkrai in the far Sinnoh region. To protect itself, it drives people and Pokémon away with terrible nightmares.
There are Pokémon called Drowzee. They put others to sleep and eat their dreams. Eating nightmares can upset their stomachs.
There are Pokémon called Hypno. Each one carries a pendulum that it can swing to make people drowsy. It has been said that a Hypno once hypnotized a child and took it away...
Some Pokémon know a move called Dream Eater. With this move, a Pokémon attacks while the target is asleep and eats its dream. It restores HP equal to half of the damage inflicted on the target.
Some Pokémon have the Forewarn Ability. A Pokémon with this Ability is alerted to one of the opposing Pokémon's moves. High-power moves will be recognized first.
A lot of books from other regions are stored on the tall shelf.

VAR(256, 1): This ship... Why is it so cold?
Cheren: And...
It seems like it's disguised as an old sailboat... But that can't be it, right?
Team Plasma: Why should you care? By the time we're done with you, it won't matter anyway!
VAR(256, 1): You guys... Seriously, this is Team Plasma's base?
Team Plasma: Correct answer! So that's why, as you can see...
There are so many of us here!
VAR(256, 1): Is this all? I think you need more backup.
Team Plasma: Ha ha ha! Oooh, I'm so scared, big tough guy! OK! Pulverize these punks! Plasmaaaa!
VAR(256, 1): Hey, just to let you know... I'm about to unleash my rage!
Team Plasma: You're first!
Team Plasma: Next! Next! Hurry up already!
Team Plasma: Go! Go! Somebody avenge me and take these guys out!
Team Plasma: It's my turn! Actually, it's Trubbish time!
Team Plasma: What's with this Trainer?! This reminds me of that Trainer who messed with us two years ago...
Team Plasma: What's with this Trainer?! This reminds me of that Trainer who messed with us two years ago...
Team Plasma: Tch! It's two against one now!
Cheren: VAR(256, 0)! I'd like to show them what the two of us can do, so could you help me out?
Cheren: Thanks! You've really become much stronger! Help out VAR(256, 1) next, OK?
Cheren: There are so many of them. What a bother!
Team Plasma: Hey, I remember you! You're gonna pay for Virbank! You and the Gym Leader are going down, so you'd better brace yourself!
Team Plasma: The Gym Leader is irritating, but you... You are a horrible little brat!
Team Plasma: This guy... More than strong, he's scary! He's really cheesed off!
Team Plasma: Look around you! See how many of us there are? Just surrender already!
Team Plasma: Ooogz... Strong for such a little brat!
Team Plasma: That little punk was too intense! Especially for someone whose head looks like a Qwilfish!
Team Plasma: You guys are too intense!
Team Plasma: I'm not losing! Well, actually, I haven't received a Pokémon yet!
Team Plasma: What's this? Are the Gym Leaders going to interfere with us again?
Team Plasma: I didn't stand a chance... And I bullied--I mean trained--my Pokémon for two whole years, too!
Team Plasma: Sniff... Our plans might fail again...
VAR(256, 1): This is a piece of cake! Go back up Cheren!
VAR(256, 1): I'm gonna end this, so back me up! OK, Plasma punk, are YOU the thief who stole a Purrloin in Aspertia five years back?
VAR(256, 1): That's the last of 'em! Well now... Why don't you tell me everything you know about Purrloin?
Cheren: Good idea... There are a lot of things I want to ask about as well.
???: What is going on?
Cheren: Oh, good grief... You're the person who was shivering in the Cold Storage, right? Wasn't your name Zinzolin? You're going to have to tell me what you're planning to do with this ship.
Zinzolin: YOU! Once again, we will use the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon and we will rule the Unova region! Curious Trainers, we shall not let you run around as you please!
Shadow Triad! Get them out of here!
Shadow Triad: By the way, we are not your...
Zinzolin: I know! But kick them out of here now!
Shadow Triad: Move.
The hatch is closed tightly.
VAR(256, 1): Take care of that guy! He's no problem for you, right?
VAR(256, 1): I'm fine... Let's try to find a way inside.
VAR(256, 1): OK! This time we'll check out the ship! When we were in Driftveil City, Zinzolin came from this direction!
This is the place... OK! I'm going!
VAR(256, 1): Hey! Come here for a sec!
Team Plasma: You! You must be friends of Smiley Swimsuit, that guy who lowered the gangplank! Aaargh! You even got the roadblock Crustle out of the way! Here I come! Plasmaaaa!
Team Plasma: Oh no! The hatch is still open!
Team Plasma: I don't know anything about your Purrloin or whatever!
Zzz... Zzz... Looks like he's asleep.
Team Plasma: The sky sure is vast.
Team Plasma: I knew... I knew that Ghetsis was using me... But I had friends here...
Intruders!
For now, let them through!
Don't try to get out of your watch with stupid talk like that!
And, um, did you find the swimsuit guy who lowered the gangplank?
Even the same Pokémon can exhibit different strengths depending on the Trainer! It's so interesting! Very, very interesting! Well, now! Give me but a moment of your time!
The invisible force that exists between you and Pokémon... This time I will determine what it is!
And I went to all the trouble to come here, too... You're an unkind person.
Well, now! Give me but a moment of your time!
The things you and your Pokémon have seen and felt... Do they belong to you and you alone? If you would, please have another Pokémon battle with me. By facing you, I feel as if I can see what I should do from now on.
Hey!
You're kidding!
This is no good...
What should we do?

VAR(256, 1): They didn't have Purrloin with them!
Barriers, huh...
The Team Plasma member was saying... Oh, I got it. We should press the switches to deactivate the barriers! VAR(256, 0)! Let's split up and look for them!

Colress: Welcome!
I was asked by an acquaintance to help with his research. What I desire is to bring out the entirety of Pokémon potential! If I can accomplish that, I don't care what it takes!
If it means this strength must be brought out by the interactions between Pokémon and Trainers, then so be it! If it means you have to use a merciless approach, like Team Plasma's, and force out all of the Pokémon's power, then so be it! And yes, if the entire world is destroyed as a result, then so be it...
That aside! The reason I have been traveling all over Unova and battling many Pokémon Trainers is because I was testing the viability of this approach to bringing out the full strength of Pokémon. In that respect, you've done an amazing job. Well now! Tell me if you have the answer I desire or not! If you're ready, come at me!
It looks like you're ready, then! OK! Let us begin!
Colress: So strong! You're a very strong Trainer indeed! So let me ask you this! Are you thinking of reaching even higher heights by understanding each other as Pokémon and Trainer?
I see... To me, that is an ideal answer. To think! That's what you actually believe! You bring out the power of your Pokémon with respect and love!
I see... Is that answer my truth? Even if that's your answer, don't give up! The reason you're so strong is that you treat your Pokémon with respect and love!
Excuse me for repeating myself, but if it will make Pokémon stronger, I don't care what it takes! If interacting with Pokémon can increase their powers only to a certain point, then their full strength must be brought out using a scientific approach. Even one without a conscience.
But you have shown me the potential of your approach. To me, whether Team Plasma wins or whether you win will decide how the relationship between people and Pokémon should be! So where will this be settled? Step on the warp panel on the other side of the room where Kyurem is being held. Good luck in your battle!
Colress: Could I say that you're curious for coming clear out here? I dissolved Team Plasma. The ones who are left here are deciding what they want to do. I would like to have them decide how to live on their own! There are far more questions in this world that don't have any answers!
Well then... Please show me you and your Pokémon's strength once again!
In Pokémon battles where you can't afford to make a mistake, the true nature of the Trainer's personality becomes clear. I see! If Trainers believe in their Pokémon to the fullest extreme, as you do, their Pokémon partners will also give everything they have! So that must be the answer I've been looking for. Still, I'm glad you won. For one thing, I detested Ghetsis from the start!
Take this with you! This Master Ball can catch any kind of Pokémon! Ghetsis was saving it, but you'll probably put it to better use!
If you'd like, please have a Pokémon battle with me again! Indeed, I'm having trouble deciding what to do next as well.

Zinzolin: You're an impressive Trainer to have made it this far.
Since you went to such trouble to come here, I'll show you something. This is...
The legendary Pokémon of ice! Its name is Kyurem!
The ice missiles we fired into Opelucid City were created with Kyurem's power and Team Plasma's technology!
Well... You could become a threat to Team Plasma, so we will eliminate you here!
Not with me around, you won't!
Thanks for removing the barrier! That was a big help!
Zinzolin: Hmph! We'll simply eliminate both of you!
VAR(256, 1): I'm not going to lose to Team Plasma! By the way, what is this place?
That Pokémon... It's so icy... Could that be the source of the attack on Opelucid City?
Zinzolin: Hmph. You're a smarter Trainer than I expected. If you've got that much sense, why did you do something as dangerous as sneaking into our base?
VAR(256, 1): That should be obvious! I'll do whatever it takes to get my sister's Pokémon back! Are YOU the one who stole a Purrloin in Aspertia five years ago?
Zinzolin: If it's just a Purrloin, someone probably stole it and is using it. Why can't you understand? There are other Purrloin. Why are you so fixated on this one?
VAR(256, 1): That's the ONLY Purrloin in the world that my late grandpa caught for my little sister!
Zinzolin: An individual's feelings... To you, that's probably a matter of great importance. But from the perspective of other people, it is a trifling matter indeed. Compare those feelings against the majesty of this ship! This ship itself is a device that uses the Pokémon Kyurem's power! With this ship, this time we will conquer Unova!
It looks like Kyurem has fully recovered. We'll put the DNA Splicers to good use. I'll let you take care of them, Shadow Triad!
VAR(256, 1): Don't mess with me! You were the one who lost!
Haaahraa...

===============================
Text File: 358
===============================
???: That blasted Colress!
The fool is far too committed to pure science. This is how he repays me for making him the boss of Team Plasma? How dare he put his personal intellectual curiosity before our ultimate mission of conquering Unova!
How fortunate for you! Few get to be the sole audience member for one of my speeches.
Team Plasma will use its knowledge and technology to take Kyurem's true power to its absolute limit and freeze the Unova region. The terrified people and Pokémon will bow at Team Plasma's...no... at MY feet!
Kyurem is an empty being. The remnants of a certain Pokémon when it split into Reshiram and Zekrom... My desire is absolute rule of Unova!
That's right! Kyurem will be the vessel into which my desires will be poured!
Shadow Triad: Lord Ghetsis. Kyurem has been transferred!
Ghetsis: It's finally here! The wonderful era in which I am the absolute ruler of Unova has finally arrived! I'll let you take care of this!
VAR(256, 1): Wait... You're one of the Shadow Triad, right? Tell me about the Purrloin that was stolen in Aspertia.
Shadow Triad: Very well... This might be it.
Grrooowwwl!
Shadow Triad: I stole this Pokémon five years ago in Aspertia. So it seems likely that it is the Pokémon you're talking about. But now, it only listens to my commands. Such is the fate of Pokémon that are trapped in Poké Balls!
VAR(256, 1): Wh-what? Don't mess with me... That's someone else's Pokémon!
Shadow Triad: Ah... I feel sorry for Pokémon. They're ruled by Poké Balls and the whims of their Trainers... Lord Ghetsis spoke of Pokémon liberation two years ago simply for his own ambitions, but... If his plans had succeeded, many Pokémon would have been saved. This Liepard--well, you knew it as a Purrloin--if it had been released, it might have returned to you. Well then...
You there! I won't let you interfere with Lord Ghetsis's plans!
Shadow Triad: You're not done yet...
Shadow Triad: If you want to go any further, you'll have to get past us.
Shadow Triad: I have no problem with you, but this is for Lord Ghetsis!
Shadow Triad: Even if I lose, Lord Ghetsis simply has to win...
Shadow Triad: We swore to be loyal to Lord Ghetsis since he saved us!
Shadow Triad: Listen well! The only thing we want is the world Lord Ghetsis desires!
Shadow Triad: Can you defeat all three of us?
Shadow Triad: No matter... The only thing you can do is watch Lord Ghetsis use Kyurem to freeze Unova solid. That's all...
You... I'll return this Pokémon to you. Considering what Lord Ghetsis is about to do, I have no further need of it.
VAR(256, 1): Sorry... This situation is messing with my head... I just don't know what to do... I finally found my sister's Pokémon, but now it's glaring at me... Why?!
VAR(256, 1): ... ... Hey... VAR(256, 0)... If we let Team Plasma do whatever they want... There'll be more sad Pokémon like Purrloin and Kyurem...
A map of the Unova region is being displayed.

Team Plasma: Wait!
No need to be suspicious! This uniform is just a disguise. I'm ex-Team Plasma! What I am now is a spy, to guard against anything bad they might cook up.
VAR(256, 1): It must be a hard job, keeping an eye on your former allies. Say, you don't know anything about a Purrloin stolen in Aspertia, do you?
S-sorry, but I don't know anything about that...
VAR(256, 1): That's what I figured. I wouldn't expect someone from a group bent on world domination to be all that quick on the uptake.
Oh... But I honestly wanted to save Pokémon...
In this ship, the Plasma Frigate, you move around by using warp panels. Look sharp!
In order to reach the heart of this ship, you need a password. Please get the password from the members of Team Plasma.
I can't remember how to use the warp panels to get around. And they won't give me a Pokémon yet... But even a guy like me has something useful to share. You step on four switches to remove the barrier!
I just joined Team Plasma, and they won't give me a Pokémon yet. But even a guy like me has something useful to share. You need the Plasma Card to enter the password!
Team Plasma has disbanded... And I finally just learned how to use the warp panels to get around! I'm so frustrated! So I'm going to stay here and use the warp panels as much as I want!

The legendary Pokémon that created the Unova region, Reshiram.

And the other legendary Pokémon, Zekrom.

If you have these Pokémon, it's so easy to control the Unova region, right?

There is a device... It seems that a card key is necessary to enter a password.
There is a device... It seems to be for entering a password. Will you enter a password?
The password is not correct.
You succeeded in entering the password!
All barriers were deactivated, and you can proceed now.
Team Plasma: At last, we meet again! Remember me? Formerly of Team Plasma? I've been waiting for you.
Gah! Spying is such a rotten job. I contacted Rood of the Seven Sages, but nobody showed up to help me. I can't stand it. Everybody around me is always saying bad stuff about Lord N. But Lord N learned the error of his ways and changed course to a better path. Yet they call him a betrayer! People really stink sometimes. They selfishly counted on him, and now they selfishly make a big fuss about being betrayed.
Oh! I nearly forgot to tell you! This floor is a maze of pipes. You've got to step on switches to connect or disconnect the pipes. It's a good thing you can walk on the pipes.
You know what troubles me... How come all of us who were in Team Plasma together--thinking we knew what was right--are now divided into former Team Plasma members and continuing Team Plasma members, both with opposing points of view? Where's the line between friend and foe? I spend a lot of time asking myself that. As for you, on this floor, you'll need to enter a password to continue on. And that password is... Ha! You didn't think I was just going to tell you the password, did you? You'll have to figure it out from the others!
Zinzolin: The device is indestructible! You will never be able to release Kyurem!
You don't have the sense to know when to quit, it seems. It's an act of mercy on my part to bring this to an end now!
Zinzolin: Beaten again?! No matter! Team Plasma will get the last laugh!
It looks like it controls the temperature inside the ship.
It's a device to control the ship's energy system.
Haahra...
Humph! If you intend to continue, step on the other warp panel. Keep in mind that you're going to get beaten up if you do!
What?! You beat Colress?! Waaah! I pretended to be strong, but I don't have any Pokémon!
I have what you want! But if you want it... You know, don't you? Battle me!
Phew! You're good! I'll give you this, then!
Without the Plasma Card, you can't enter the password. Do the rest by yourself.
Oh, poor Kyurem. It was cruelly forced to work. It must have felt terrible.
The Plasma Frigate is a ship designed to be ecological. It runs on Kyurem's ice energy and solar panels. You've got to keep the environment in mind when ruling a region like Unova.
Colress doesn't know N. I wonder how he'll react if he meets him.
Be careful! The barriers are electrified!

VAR(256, 1): Go on ahead! I'm going to make them tell me about the Shadow Triad! If you find Purrloin or the Shadow Triad, let me know!
You... Where are the Shadow Triad?
Cretin! Don't interfere with Team Plasma's conquest of Unova!
Struggle and squirm! Kyurem's ice is more powerful than Reshiram's columns of fire or Zekrom's crackling lightning!
H-he's terrifying! He can't be human! But he has a silly-looking Qwilfish hairstyle!
All of Unova will be frozen with Kyurem's ice! I wonder if Zinzolin will be OK... He really doesn't like the cold.

Team Plasma: Who are you?
VAR(256, 1): Just to let you know... You're about to feel my rage!
Team Plasma: Ugh...! We have to tell the others.
Team Plasma: Oh no! At this rate, they'll get through our barriers!
VAR(256, 1): They didn't have Purrloin with them!
Barriers, huh...
And there's a device where you enter a password here...
That means... We either have to find the password, or get it out of Team Plasma, to deactivate the barriers. VAR(256, 0)! Let's split up and find that password!
There is a device... It seems that a card key is necessary to enter a password.
There is a device... It seems to be for entering a password. Will you enter a password?
The password is not correct.
You succeeded in entering the password!
All the barriers were deactivated, and now you can proceed!
Be careful! The barriers are electrified!

A barrier was deactivated!
All barriers were deactivated, and you can proceed now.
Team Plasma: At last, we meet again! Remember me? Formerly of Team Plasma? I've been waiting for you.
Gah! Spying is such a rotten job. I contacted Rood of the Seven Sages, but nobody showed up to help me. I can't stand it. Everybody around me is always saying bad stuff about Lord N. But Lord N learned the error of his ways and changed course to a better path. Yet they call him a betrayer! People really stink sometimes. They selfishly counted on him, and now they selfishly make a big fuss about being betrayed.
Oh! I nearly forgot to tell you! This floor is a maze of pipes. You've got to step on switches to connect or disconnect the pipes. It's a good thing you can walk on the pipes.
You know what troubles me... How come all of us who were in Team Plasma together--thinking we knew what was right--are now divided into former Team Plasma members and continuing Team Plasma members, both with opposing points of view? Where's the line between friend and foe? I spend a lot of time asking myself that. As for you, on this floor, you'll need to deactivate barriers to continue on. Deactivate them by stepping on switches. Move around by stepping on warp panels, and you'll find four switches.
Zinzolin: The device is indestructible! You will never be able to release Kyurem!
You don't have the sense to know when to quit, it seems. It's an act of mercy on my part to bring this to an end now!
Zinzolin: Beaten again?! No matter! Team Plasma will get the last laugh!
It looks like it controls the temperature inside the ship.
It's a device to control the ship's energy system.
Haahra...
Humph! If you intend to continue, step on the other warp panel. Keep in mind that you're going to get beaten up if you do!
What?! You beat Colress?! Waaah! I pretended to be strong, but I don't have any Pokémon!
Oh, poor Kyurem. Ghetsis's device cruelly forced it to work. It must have felt terrible.

I make bread every day. That's what I like, so I'm satisfied, but I wonder if everybody is fine with only bread and water every day.
Eat a lot! You can't love anyone on an empty stomach!
Colress told me that if I can bring out the power of Pokémon by taking good care of them, I can stay here!
As long as I did what Team Plasma ordered, I was able to eat bread... I didn't think for myself, and that's why I became like this. Ah! But the bread here is yummy!

Reshiram has been registered in the Pokédex.
And this is the legendary Electric-type Pokémon Zekrom.
Zekrom has been registered in the Pokédex.
I yearned for them since I was a child. When I saw them two years ago, I was so moved that I cried!

It's you the announcement was warning about? Fine. I'm very strong. I'll look the other way for a child like you...
I failed in my duty, and my Pokémon were taken away. I lost a lot of Pokémon I had stolen, too...

Argh! I was doing very well. I was so close! But I lost. I shouldn't have forced myself to battle and should have looked for a Nurse. The White Treehollow is not known as Unova's Challenge for nothing.
I heard you already cleared Area 5! Argh! I have to keep up! I'll catch up with you soon!
Hey, you! I heard you finished all of the Areas. I can't believe it... But anyway, congratulations!
What is there at the lowest level of Unova's Challenge, the White Treehollow...? ...Hmm. I will be the first one to solve the mystery!
He he he! Listen! I finally went to Area 3! ...What? You already cleared Area 5? There's always somebody above me...
He he! Going through fierce battles, I finally cleared the Area! That dangerous Area 5! ...You. Did you go to the lowest level? Haha... You're something... ...Someday, I want to see the lowest level with my own eyes, too...

They say Area 6 is located so high that you cannot see it from the ground... I wonder how high it is. As a researcher, I'm very interested.
I heard that you cleared the Area at the top, too... Great! Literally, you're a person above the clouds!
I sense strong power that I've never felt before... I can't stop...trembling... I wonder what is hidden in this Unova's Challenge?
What is this power? It's getting stronger and stronger! Uh... I'm all tingly inside... Unova's Challenge, the Black Tower... What kind of secret does it have...?
When I heard that you cleared all of the Areas, all became clear to me. The power that I've felt... The power that made me tremble... It was the potential you possess!

Hello. Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry to ask, but will you buy a bottle of Fresh Water for $300?
Thank you very much! Buying Fresh Water for $300, which is more expensive than usual... What a generous person you are! I'll never forget your kindness for the rest of my life!
Yes, I know. I know! $300 a bottle is expensive! But, if I don't sell this, I'll be in trouble...
My wife wants to buy a Bag from a really expensive brand... If I don't buy it for her, our relationship might go sour...
I have a daughter who's a Trainer. It's natural for a father to want to buy a lot of things like new Ultra Balls and Hyper Potions for his daughter...
My son and his wife send me money, but they can't send very much... I know I shouldn't rely on them, but there is a lot going on.
I want to buy some toys for my adorable grandchildren. Their tastes are quite expensive. But I want to see their happy faces...
I don't really have any special reasons... But the full-course meal I ate yesterday was incredibly expensive!
So, to help this old man... Please buy my Fresh Water for $300. Please.
Sigh... Well, since you're stubborn, I'll stop asking. But when you change your mind, please come back anytime. I'll be selling Fresh Water for $300 right here!
Y-you... $300... You don't have it?! I didn't say anything! Don't worry. You don't have to buy Fresh Water.
You... You can't carry any more Fresh Water! Wow! You're a Fresh Water maniac! Please buy it from me next time you need some!

The curve here is like...errrrk... and then when you pass the curve, whoooosh, zoooom! ...Do you understand the dialect of Goldenrod City?

Sometimes, above the bridge, you can see the shadows of bird Pokémon, right? Their feathers drift to the ground here! And when you try to pick them up, occasionally you'll run into a Pokémon.

Driftveil City is famous for this drawbridge, the PWT, and of course, the heartbreaker, Charles.
The Driftveil Drawbridge... It's also known as the Charizard Bridge! Because the raised drawbridge looks like the Pokémon called Charizard. ...But, I've never seen Charizard, so I don't know...

Argh! Loud! It's way too noisy! It's all the trains! They never stop! When the train runs below, it's unbearably noisy!

I understand. I've got a 999-win streak! It's natural to be intimidated. But I can't let you go further unless you battle me! And there's definitely no way around me. Nope. You shouldn't use Surf to cross the river, for example.

Russo: Testing... Check one, check two, check, check, yup.
Russo: Now, you're the first person in an awful long time who's hung around to listen and hear what I was singin' about. Much obliged!
Koontz: Singing gives life to my spirit. Will you listen to the voice of my spirit?
Koontz: Huh? Are you leaving already? I am always here.
Koontz: Oh, you want to listen to my song after all! Yes!
Koontz: My song... Don't you like it?
I hear a sound from somewhere. Sometimes it sounds sad. Sometimes it sounds a little goofy... Do you think it could be a ghost?
I hear a sound from somewhere. Sometimes it sounds sad. Sometimes it sounds a little goofy... Do you think it could be a ghost? What? A girl practicing music in that house? I see! I got it! Thank you! Accept these as a thank-you gift!
Keep somebody's secret. Otherwise, your secret will be out.
I tried to ask for directions, but it turned out I was talking to a Pokémon Trainer! You need to be careful, too.

My great-great-great-grandfather and his Gurdurr worked together and built this Village Bridge.
I'll be a stonecutter like my grandpa! I can get help from powerful Pokémon!
If Team Plasma had tricked everyone into releasing all their Pokémon, it would have been impossible to build a bridge like this. People and Pokémon are inseparable... The relationship is not more or less than that. That's what I believe.

All right! I want to bake tasty bread for strong Pokémon!
Uh-oh... That's fine. When you change your mind, come back!
Let's battle without saying a word! Are you ready?
Wow, what a Trainer! You understand and trust your Pokémon. That's why you got this result!
I have a favor to ask of such a wonderful Trainer! I'm planning to bake bread with tons of Honey! Would you show me a Pokémon with the Honey Gather Ability?
This VAR(257, 0) will gather Honey! Thank you! This gift is a token of my gratitude!
This VAR(257, 0) will gather Honey! Thank you! This gift is a token of my gratitude!
This bread will have tons of Honey. I'll call it Honey Bread! I want to bake it soon, but I'm busy making Village Sandwiches.

Pokémon make the most adorable faces when they bite into sandwiches!
I'm so happy to be able to eat with my Pokémon.

Oh! A Trainer! You got here without any delay! As I told you on Route 8, I'm a member of the Hip Waders. As its name suggests, it's a fishing club! Why don't you join up and enjoy some fishing?
Hey, Trainer! Why don't you join the Hip Waders and do some fishing?
That's the way the tide turns, huh? But, I won't give up. If you change your mind, come see me again!
Awesome! Now you are the second member of the Hip Waders!
Here we go! I'll announce the Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day! The Pokémon we're fishing for today is VAR(257, 0)! If you catch one, please show it to me!
The Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day is VAR(257, 0)! Have you caught one already?
That's great! Show it to me!
Oh! This is a great VAR(257, 0)! That's why you're the second member of the Hip Waders! Cool! Take these with you!
Oh! This is a great VAR(257, 0)! ...But when it comes to the Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day, a Pokémon you caught before today doesn't count. Sorry!
Oh! This is a great VAR(257, 0)! But it's not the Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day. Sorry!
The Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day is VAR(257, 0)! I'm counting on you, Member No. 2!
The appeal of fishing... That's something you have to discover through experience, rather than listening to me explaining about it! Right, Member No. 2?
Yo! Member No. 2! Times have changed... That's right! Because today is a new day, we've got a new Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day! Isn't it exciting?

Why don't we move into this house? Those musicians are always nearby. Isn't that nice?
I learned all the names of the musicians! Derleth, Aickman, Russo, and Koontz.
What do you think? We've been indecisive for two years. Let's live here, shall we?
Maybe we should move in. We don't even know when the villa in Undella Town will be finished...

This is what the undersea world looks like! I've never seen this before, because I can't swim! I'd given up on seeing this. I'm so moved!
This place is like a walk-through aquarium, but isn't this a place for Pokémon to see us?
Wow! It's an ocean trench! So deep! Maybe six miles deep?
That's right... It's deep... Love is infinitely deep...
Rain Dance is a move to use with a feeling of yearning. As for when to use it... Sigh... What's wrong with me? I can't think of any gripping ideas. With a condition like this, I can't explain well on TV.

How is your Pokédex coming along? Can I see it?
Let me see... Oh, you've seen VAR(514, 0) Pokémon in the Unova region!
Let me see... Oh, you've caught VAR(514, 0) Pokémon in the Unova region!
This Pokédex is full of memories from your journey. It's a treasure you can cherish for your entire life.
If you want to meet more Pokémon, you should try walking through tall grass!
It seems a little more like a Pokédex now! You're getting off to a good start!
Some Pokémon are hard to find, but don't give up! Keep checking the tall grass.
Trainers have a lot of different Pokémon. So battling them is a great way to fill up your Pokédex, too!
Some Pokémon are only found in certain caves! You might want to go back and search caves you've already passed through.
Wow, it's getting really full! I'm sure looking over your Pokédex will bring back memories of your journey.
Over 100 Pokémon... It's so much fun looking over all their different characteristics!
Bianca probably told you about it, but are you checking the rustling grass, too? The more you walk, the more your chance of finding rustling grass increases.
There are various Abilities, but do you fully understand them? Certain Abilities make wild Pokémon come out more often!
It may be hard to find their entrances in the trees, but you should look for Hidden Grottoes. I don't know why, but Pokémon that live there all have quite uncommon Abilities!
Over 200 different Pokémon! This world is filled with so many Pokémon interacting with one another!
It's incredible that the number of kinds of Pokémon has increased this much over such a short time. The adaptability of Pokémon is amazing.
That is an excellent Pokédex! Just a little more, and it will be full!
What a wonderful Pokédex! A little more work, and it'll be complete! I'm really glad I asked you to do this!
Amazing! Truly amazing! You've met all of the Pokémon in the Unova region! Congratulations! Now here's your next challenge: see how many of those Pokémon you can catch! I'll keep evaluating for you!
Little by little, more detailed information is being entered into the Pokédex! Do your best!
Are you trying out different kinds of Poké Balls for your captures? They come in lots of varieties, so be sure to use the right one at the right time!
If you read the Pokédex descriptions, you can learn a lot of unexpected facts about Pokémon! It's fun!
Evolving Pokémon is another important way to fill up your Pokédex. It's not just about catching them!
Trading Pokémon with friends also counts as catching them!
When you've met this many Pokémon, do you have trouble picking which ones to travel with?
Over 100 different Pokémon! Great! Identify your goal using the Habitat List. That way, you may be able to motivate yourself even more.
Some moves are very useful for catching Pokémon, right? Teaching False Swipe to your Pokémon is one such approach.
You can't meet some Pokémon unless you find their Eggs!
Depending on the season, some Pokémon are easier to find and some Pokémon are harder to find.
You've caught more than 200 different Pokémon! I'm glad that I entrusted the Pokédex to such a wonderful Trainer.
Even after researching so many Pokémon... their origin... where they were born... There are so many things we still don't know.
You've caught so many Pokémon. You might know more than me now! I'm cheering for you to complete your Pokédex!
With just a little more effort, you will have completed a perfect Pokédex! You've come this far, so don't give up... No, just enjoy it as much as possible!
Amazing! Absolutely amazing! You've caught every Pokémon in the Unova region! Congratulations!!
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at a good clip! I have something I want to give you! Please come to the lab when you can.
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at a good clip! Here! This is a gift to thank you for all your hard work!
If you have a Permit, you can go to the Nature Preserve from Mistralton City by plane! Go check it out to see what kind of place it is!
If you have an Oval Charm, we don't know why, but you'll have a better chance to find Eggs at the Pokémon Day Care!
If you have a Shiny Charm, we don't know why, but you'll have a better chance to find Shiny Pokémon!
Try using this, too!
Keep up the good work!
You're here to show me how your Pokédex is coming along, right?
I see! You've caught VAR(514, 0) Pokémon, then...
Oh, really... If you want me to have a look at your Pokédex, come here again!
Nationally, there are more than 600 Pokémon! You'll have to be persistent and catch them at your own pace.
First, you might want to revisit places you've already been. Retrace your steps in the Unova region and see what new Pokémon turn up!
Remember Rule No. 1! To catch a Pokémon, you first have to reduce its HP. You're pretty good at this now, but don't forget the basics!
Are you going to the Day Care? I've heard that some Pokémon can only be caught if they are hatched from Eggs.
Do you have a fishing rod? There are many Pokémon that live in the water. Try searching rivers and oceans!
Do you know the move False Swipe? False Swipe always leaves a tiny bit of the targeted Pokémon's HP. It's great for catching, because it doesn't make them faint!
Do you know the move Mean Look? If you use Mean Look on a Pokémon, it can't run away!
There are several ways for Pokémon to evolve. Some Pokémon even evolve through friendship!
Have you heard of mass outbreaks? Big groups of Pokémon appear during a mass outbreak. It's a great chance to catch them!
You've caught more than 400 different Pokémon?! That's incredible! You're an amazing Trainer!
Apparently, some Pokémon evolve when they are leveled up in a certain area.
You've caught 500 different Pokémon... My, the variation of these beings called Pokémon certainly is surprising! And the fact that you've caught so many different kinds... That's pretty surprising, too!
Have you been to the Poké Transfer Lab on Route 15? Mastering a facility like that is an accomplishment for a Pokémon Trainer.
Just a little more until you complete your Pokédex, huh? Catching this many Pokémon must mean... You really like Pokémon, don't you!
Oh! That's a wonderful Pokédex. How about it? Would you research Pokémon with me?
Oh! Just a little more until your Pokédex is complete! Make sure you go trade with friends to get the ones you're missing!
... ... This blows me away! It's so wonderful, I'm at a loss for words. You... You've accomplished something truly outstanding. Filling up the National Pokédex makes you a Trainer among Trainers! I'm so happy I was able to meet a fantastic Trainer like you! I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Oh! We have a gift for you. My daughter has it. Go speak to her and get it!

How are you enjoying Unova's Challenge, the White Treehollow? I'm interested in seeing how strong you have become since our last battle! Show me your strength!
I hear you've grown even stronger since our last battle. I'm glad I have the chance to battle you again. This time it will be me challenging you!

Hmm? Oh, it's you again. Nice to see you. It's a bit of a pain, but since you came this far, I suppose we should battle!
You keep on battling, huh? I'm still searching for the true meaning of strength. Show me what kind of strength you are trying to obtain!
You and us! Our Pokémon! The strength we have! We'll give it our all! No holding back!
What does it mean to be the strongest? Have you found the answer? If not, let's keep on battling until we find the answer!

Welcome to the White Treehollow, newcomer. Looks like the gate Trainer recognized your abilities. Now it's time for me to evaluate just how good you are! Don't hold back against me. Let's battle!
Impressive to have made it this far without giving up. You'd better give it all you've got if you want to beat me. Don't want all of your efforts to have been in vain, do you? Time to complete Area 2 and graduate from being a newcomer!
I didn't stand a chance... That last Trainer was in another league. Makes me jealous that someone else has so much natural talent and strength! Oh well, enough of that! It's your turn next! Come at me!
What do you think of the White Treehollow? Strange place, huh? We don't even know how far down this place goes. Makes you wonder what's at the bottom, though, doesn't it? Time to see if you have the strength to make it that far down!
So, you're the next challenger. I hope you can provide me with at least some entertainment. I came here to battle against strong Trainers! I'll decide if you count as one! Let's get this started!
Hmm? What's a kid like you doing around here? You'd better be serious if you plan on battling in this area. Go back to Area 5 if you're looking to play with the other kids. ...Oh? So, you're seriously aiming to advance to the next area, eh? All right. I'll see if you've got what it takes! Bring it on!
Oh! Here comes another one! You're a challenger, right? You came for a battle, so let's have one! The more I battle, the stronger I become! This place is a paradise for Trainers like me, who just crave battles! So... What kind of Pokémon are you going to use? This better be fun!
Hmm? Another challenger? Good job making it this far! But, isn't it enough for you to have made it this far? Oh? You want to keep going? A real fighter, aren't you? Well, whatever. I'd rather not, but I suppose we should have a battle.
Do you like battling? Day after day, I continue to battle, but I still don't know what true strength is. ...Oh, excuse me! A Trainer can't talk like this! Show me what kind of strength you have!
Back in Grampa Alder's house. We promised, remember? We're gonna compete with each other. And see who's stronger!
I'm here battling everyone in sight in order to become the strongest Trainer! You're here for the same purpose, right? What does it mean to be the strongest? That's the question in your head, right? You came here for the answer, right? I think our battle may bring us one step closer to finding out just who is the strongest in Unova! It's too bad no one is here to watch our battle, but let's have a good one! Let's get this battle on!
Welcome to the Black Tower, newcomer. Looks like the gate Trainer recognized your abilities. Now it's time for me to evaluate just how good you are! Don't hold back against me. Let's battle!

I didn't stand a chance... That last Trainer was in another league. Makes me jealous that someone else has so much natural talent and strength! Oh well, enough of that! It's your turn next! Come at me!
What do you think of the Black Tower? There's no building taller in Unova! None of us even know how high up it goes. Makes you wonder what's at the top, though, doesn't it? Time to see if you have the strength to make it that far up!
So, you're the next challenger. I hope you can provide me with at least some entertainment. I just love battling with strong Trainers! I'll decide if you count as one! Let's get this started!
Hmm? What's a kid like you doing around here? You'd better be serious if you plan on battling in this area. Go back to Area 5 if you're looking to play with the other kids. ...Oh? So, you're seriously aiming to advance to the next area, are you? All right. I'll battle you! Let's see what you've got!
Oh! Here comes another one! You're a challenger, right? You came for a battle, so let's have one! The more I battle, the stronger I become! This place is a paradise for Trainers like me, who just crave battles! So... What kind of Pokémon are you going to use? This better be fun!
Why, hello! Are you another challenger? Good job coming this far! But, isn't it enough for you to have made it this far? Oh? You want to keep going? You'll need to defeat me first! Well, I guess you're determined. Let's battle then, shall we?
Do you like battling? Day after day, I continue to battle, but I still don't know what true strength is. ...Oh, excuse me! A Trainer can't talk like this! Show me what kind of strength you have!
Back in Grampa Alder's house. We promised, remember? We're gonna compete with each other. And see who's stronger!
I'm here battling everyone in sight in order to become the strongest Trainer! You're here for the same purpose, right? What does it mean to be the strongest? That's the question in your head, right? You came here for the answer, right? I think our battle may bring us one step closer to finding out just who is the strongest in Unova! It's too bad no one is here to watch our battle, but let's have a good one! Let's start this battle!
You've gotten a lot stronger. Can't call you a newcomer anymore! I'm excited to see just how far you'll go. Come challenge me again sometime!
You got a lot stronger! It seems like only yesterday you were the newcomer. Either that, or I just got a lot weaker. Looks like I need to get in some real training.
I couldn't beat you this time, either. You sure are strong. I've got to train a lot harder. I won't lose next time!
Wow! You got even stronger. What a big difference compared to last time. Just how far can you go? Making it to the bottom is quite the accomplishment.
Looks like I couldn't win. I'm excited to find out just how strong you'll become! I'll do my best to make sure I can beat you the next time we battle.
You're even better than before! I'll admit it--you're tough! If you want to find strong Trainers like yourself, check the areas up ahead.
It's not enough! I want to battle you even more! You'd better come back sometime! You'd better battle with me again!
All right. Good battle! What's that? You still want to battle? You sure are greedy! Then again, you've got to know what you want to survive up ahead. Well, if you feel up to it, come back some other time. I'll battle you again.
Did this battle help you get any closer to becoming whatever it is you're aiming to become? I'll battle with you until you find the answer. As many times as it takes. Come back again sometime!
So exciting! My grampa was the Champion! But Trainers like you are even stronger! We just need to keep competing. Then we can keep aiming higher. As Pokémon Trainers! And as people! And it's all thanks to our Pokémon! Come again! I want to keep aiming higher!
You're strong. There's no doubt that you're the strongest Trainer in the White Treehollow... However, it remains to be seen if you're the strongest in Unova... There's still all sorts of powerful Trainers that you haven't met yet. Keep it up, and never stop aiming for the top!
You've gotten a lot stronger. Can't call you a newcomer anymore! I'm excited to see just how far you'll go. Come challenge me again sometime!

Wow! You got even stronger. What a big difference compared to last time. Just how far can you go? Let me know if you ever make it to the top.
Looks like I couldn't win. I'm excited to find out just how strong you'll become! I'll do my best to make sure I can beat you the next time we battle.
You're even better than before! I'll admit it--you're tough! If you want to become even stronger, go on to the next area.
It's not enough! I want to battle you even more! You'd better come back sometime! You'd better battle with me again!
All right. Good battle! What's that? You still want to battle? You sure are greedy! Then again, you've got to know what you want to survive up ahead. Well, if you feel up to it, come back some other time. I'll battle you again.

You're more impressive than I imagined. I'll give you one final hint that you may find useful. You encountered all kinds of Trainers on your way here, right? Did you notice that the information each of them knew was different? Some know where the gate Trainer is, and some know where a Doctor is, for example. Try battling with all of the Trainers to find the best way through this place. Be on your way now. I look forward to hearing all about your exploits.
Congratulations! You've graduated from newcomer status. You've still got a long way to go, though! Good luck in the next area.
Impressive! You've certainly proven your strength. In honor of your completion of Area 3, I'll give you a hint about Area 4. Starting with Area 4, the areas become much larger! This means it becomes even harder to find the gate Trainer. Pay close attention to the hints that the other Trainers give you, and do your best to find the gate Trainer. Good luck! I'm excited to see how far you will make it!
You got me! You sure are strong... With strength like yours, you might just be able to make it to the top. Good luck in the next area!
You're strong! But don't let it go to your head... There are other Trainers just as strong as you, or even stronger, up ahead! When you run into one of those Trainers, I'd sure like to be there to witness the battle! Come back again sometime!
I give up! I give up! You win. I guess age doesn't matter when it comes to Pokémon strength. But you'd better keep your guard up. The Trainers up ahead have dedicated their lives to battling. I look forward to seeing how far you can prevail!
I lost! I lost! I haven't lost this badly in a long time! Get on to the next area. I'll be waiting here for the next challenger. I wonder who it will be? I can't wait to battle!
Oh, dear. It looks like I lost. You're a strong one, aren't you? You're already that strong, but you still have your sights set higher... Just how far will you go? Will your rise ever end? I hope you can achieve whatever goal you've set for yourself!
What amazing strength! You might just have the kind of strength that I've been looking for... I felt the same kind of strength from a young man I battled some time ago... How did you come across such strength? Tell me your secret someday!
So exciting! You and your Pokémon's combination! Amazing teamwork! Places where humans can't go alone. Places where Pokémon don't think to go. You can go anywhere with teamwork. Between Trainers and Pokémon! Like you and me! I'm glad you understand that now! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! You'd better come to Grampa's house! You know where it is: in Floccesy Town! I'll give you something awesome! It's a promise, OK?
So strong... I've never met another Trainer as strong as you. That was the most intense battle I've had in my entire life! Did you get a glimpse of what it means to be the strongest? I think that you may have a chance at achieving that!

Your Pokémon look tired... Shall I recover them?
OK. If you want me to recover your Pokémon, just let me know!
Training is important, but make sure you're not overworking your Pokémon!
What's wrong? Your Pokémon look tired! Shall I recover them?
OK! Just remember not to overdo it!
You've still got a long road ahead. Good luck!
Welcome! This is Unova's Challenge-- the Black Tower! Please, let me know what you would like to do.
Which area would you like to challenge?
Would you like to challenge this area?
Are you all ready to go? Good luck to you!
This facility was made to provide a place where Trainers could come to focus on training. Inside, you will find many other Trainers who also came to this facility to challenge themselves. When you run into another Trainer, they will surely challenge you to a battle. Defeat all of the Trainers that block your way to complete an area.
In order to complete an area, you must find the Boss Trainer of the area and defeat him or her in battle. By defeating the Boss Trainer, you can advance on to the next area. If you'd like, you can simply battle with other Trainers to improve your skills. You can also focus on finding the Boss Trainer to complete the area. So how about it? Would you like to challenge yourself and find out just how strong you really are? A word of warning: once you enter the facility, usage of items inside your Bag is prohibited. We thank you for your cooperation.
Thank you. Please come again.
We will recover your Pokémon before you begin your challenge.
VAR(256, 0)! Excuse me! Congratulations on completing Area VAR(513, 1)! Please accept this prize in honor of your accomplishment!
In addition, you will now be able to challenge Area VAR(513, 0)! We look forward to your continued success in future challenges.
VAR(256, 0)! Excuse me! We keep this a secret from the general public, but this facility contains some very special areas. Areas 6 and beyond are these special areas!
Did you notice this elevator? Ride this elevator if you want to challenge Areas 6 and beyond. But, be careful! Areas 6 and beyond are outside of our administration. We don't actually know what kind of Trainers are in there...
Furthermore, it's rumored that Areas 6 and beyond contain more floors per area than the earlier areas. If you can't find the Trainer you're looking for, try a different floor. Just use the elevator to move between the floors of an area. Anyway, if you're thinking about challenging Areas 6 and beyond, make sure you've trained your Pokémon sufficiently and are fully prepared!
VAR(256, 0)! Excuse me! ...All of the areas? Can that be true? Incredible! Congratulations! To commemorate your conquering the areas, please accept this prize!
Please continue aiming to become the top Trainer in the land! Good luck!
VAR(256, 0)! Excuse me! Are you OK? It's too bad things didn't work out, but better luck next time!
Excuse me, VAR(256, 0). You've decided to quit, then? I am quite sorry about this, but I'm afraid I have to take back the prize money you won during your challenge. The total amount comes to $VAR(518, 1). I wish you better luck next time!
So, you've decided to quit, VAR(256, 0)? Too bad, but better luck next time!
Hey! Welcome! Welcome! This is Unova's Challenge-- the White Treehollow! What would you like to do today?
Which area do you want to challenge?
Do you want to challenge this area?
You look all ready to go! Best of luck in there!
This facility was made so that you Trainers can come and train to your heart's content. Inside, you'll find lots of other Trainers who also came here to challenge themselves. When you run into another Trainer, they'll surely challenge you to a battle. Defeat all of the Trainers that are in your way to complete an area.
If you want to complete an area, you've got to find and defeat the Boss Trainer of that area. By defeating the Boss Trainer, you can advance on to the next area. If you want, you can simply battle with other Trainers to improve your skills. You can also focus on finding the Boss Trainer to complete the area. Well, what are you waiting for? Get in there and test your strength! There's a ton of powerful Trainers inside! Oh yeah! Once you're inside, you can't use any of the items in your Bag. Don't you forget it!
You come back, now.
We'll recover your Pokémon before you start your challenge.
Hey! VAR(256, 0)! Looks like you completed Area VAR(513, 1)! Here's a prize to commemorate your success!
Oh yeah, you can also challenge Area VAR(513, 0) now! Good luck in your future challenges.
Hey! VAR(256, 0)! I'm letting you in on a secret here, but this facility actually contains some very special areas. I'm talking about Areas 6 and beyond!
Did you ever wonder about this elevator? Take a ride on it if you want to challenge Areas 6 and beyond. But, be careful! Areas 6 and beyond are outside of our administration. We don't actually know what kind of Trainers are in there...
Furthermore, it's rumored that Areas 6 and beyond contain more floors per area than the earlier areas. If you can't find the Trainer you're looking for, try a different floor. Just use the elevator to move between the floors of an area. Anyway, if you're thinking about challenging Areas 6 and beyond, make sure you've trained your Pokémon sufficiently and are fully prepared!
Hey! VAR(256, 0)! ...All of the areas? Can that be true? You sure know how to impress! Congratulations! To commemorate your conquering the areas, please accept this prize!
Don't get complacent, though! Keep on aiming to become the top Trainer in the land!
Hey! VAR(256, 0)! You OK? It's too bad things didn't work out, but better luck next time!
Hey! VAR(256, 0)! You quit, eh? I'm sorry it's got to be like this, but I have to take back the prize money you won during your challenge. The total comes out to $VAR(518, 1). Better luck next time, huh?
VAR(256, 0)! You quit? Too bad, but better luck next time!

Hmm? Are you a new challenger? Is that so? That expression on your face is telling me that you've got no idea what to do. All right! I suppose I can spare some advice for a newcomer. First of all, you should know that in order to complete an area and advance, you must defeat the Boss Trainer. You can try to seek out the Boss Trainer without any leads if you want. However, it's probably a better idea to challenge the other Trainers first. A lot of them know quite a bit about the area and might be able to provide you with useful information!
Oh? If it isn't the challenger that everyone's talking about! I've heard quite a lot about you. You're still new here, so I'll give you some advice. You know about the elevators, right? If you feel like you can't continue any longer, come back to the elevator in the area and return to the lobby. Any prize money you won in the area will be taken back, but a first-class Trainer knows when it's time to quit. Testing your limits can be a good thing, but don't overdo it!
Have you come to challenge the Black Tower? Oh, me? I'm here for a different reason. I've come to investigate this facility. Don't you think this place is strange? I mean, this building wasn't even here two years ago. It's full of mysteries, I'm telling you. Anyway, see you around!
Oh, it's you again! I've been investigating this place the whole time and learned some interesting things. Apparently, a certain financial group funded the construction of this place. I still don't know why and for what purpose they built this place, though. I've heard rumors that they're watching the Trainers in here battle for their entertainment from some remote location. Others say that they built this place so they could find a Trainer that's stronger than the Champion! There are all sorts of rumors, but I just can't verify any of them. The more I investigate this place, the more interesting stories I come across. Anyway, see you around!
Hey! You made it to Area 5! I've done even more investigation since the last time we met and found out some interesting new information. The real purpose of this place is to gather data on Pokémon battles. Battle-loving Trainers from across the land happily gather here for a challenge. All the while, there's someone out there monitoring and gathering data on all of these battles. But a Pokémon's true strength isn't decided just by data. It's all about the teamwork between a Trainer and his or her Pokémon. That's what really decides a Pokémon's true strength. Well, I'm heading off to my next investigation site. There's this quiet town, full of nature, where suddenly a massive tree appeared! Well, I guess this is good-bye!
Oh, hey! You made it this far, huh? You and your Pokémon sure make a great team! I tell you, it's the teamwork between humans and Pokémon that brought the world to where it is today. Throughout history we've complemented each other to overcome all obstacles! It might be that this place exists so we can experience that history firsthand! See you around!
Hmm? Are you a new challenger? Oh, my... That expression on your face is telling me that you've got no idea what to do. All right! I suppose I can spare some advice for a newcomer. First of all, you should know that in order to complete an area and advance, you must defeat the Boss Trainer. You can try to seek out the Boss Trainer without any leads if you want. However, it's probably a better idea to challenge the other Trainers first. A lot of them know quite a bit about the area and might be able to provide you with useful information!
Oh? If it isn't the challenger that everyone's talking about! I hear you're stronger than you look. You're still new here, so I'll give you some advice. You know about the elevators, right? If you feel like you can't continue any longer, come back to the elevator in the area and return to the lobby. Any prize money you won in the area will be taken back, so it's important to know when to quit. Testing your limits can be a good thing, but don't overdo it!
Have you come to challenge the White Treehollow? Oh, me? I'm here for a different reason. I'm just on a journey to become even stronger. Enough about that... Don't you think this place is strange? I mean, it wasn't even here two years ago. It's full of mysteries, I'm telling you. Whatever. I'm satisfied as long as I can continue my training. Anyway, see you around!
Oh, hey! It's you again! Get this! I heard a really strange story about this place! Apparently, some conservation group did a thorough investigation of this place before opening it up to the public. I wonder why they opened up this place as a training facility... I guess it's because this place is so huge. You don't have to worry about other stuff and can focus on training. Anyway, see you around!
Hey! You made it to Area 5! Oh yeah. I learned the reason why this place was opened up for us Trainers! Apparently, this place wasn't actually fully explored before they opened it up! They're letting Trainers battle and train in here, but the real reason they opened this place up is to have strong Trainers explore the depths of this place! That is, Trainers just like you, who have strong bonds with their Pokémon! I wonder if you'll ever make your way to the bottom. Well, I think I'm just about done training in here. For the next stop on my journey, I've decided to check out the rumors about a building that was suddenly constructed in a certain city. Strength isn't something that you can achieve in just one day. Let's both do our best!
Oh, hey! You made it this far, huh? You and your Pokémon sure make a great team! I tell you, it's the teamwork between humans and Pokémon that brought the world to where it is today. Throughout history we've complemented each other to overcome all obstacles! It might be that this place exists so we can experience that history firsthand! See you around!
Hey, newcomer! How are you doing? Take a look around this room. See that strange door? That's a gate that leads into the room where the Boss Trainer waits. The gate is closed right now, though, so you can't go through. First, you'll need to find the gate Trainer somewhere in this area and get him or her to open the gate for you. However, they'll only open the gate for Trainers that they deem to be strong enough! So, it's up to you to battle the gate Trainer and prove your strength! Oh, by the way, the gate Trainer of this area is actually me! I'll be waiting for you somewhere in this area, so come find me!
Oh, hi! We meet again! How are you doing? Remember, you can't use items in here. Aren't you and your Pokémon starting to get a bit tired? If you are, seek out a Doctor! Just talk to one of them, and the Doctor should recover your Pokémon. You'll have to have a battle first, though. Well, I'm gonna go on ahead. Don't keep me waiting too long!
Wow, you've made it this far! Impressive. Since you're trying so hard, I'll give you another hint. When you've lost your way! When your Pokémon are feeling down! When you want to leave immediately! This book comes in handy in times like those. The book is called “Adventure Rules for Unova's Challenge"! It says here, “Press the X Button to make the RETIRE button appear. Press that to return to the lobby!" Of course, if you choose to retire, your challenge will be considered a failure, so choose wisely! I'm the gate Trainer for this area, so I'll be waiting for you somewhere! Come find me!

Well, hello. We meet again. How are you doing? You know that you can't use items in here, right? Aren't you and your Pokémon starting to get a bit tired? If you are, seek out a Nurse! Just talk to one of them, and the Nurse should recover your Pokémon. You'll have to have a battle first, though. Well, I'm going on ahead. Don't keep me waiting too long!
You're doing well! I knew you would make it this far. Here, I'll give you another hint. When you've lost your way! When your Pokémon are feeling down! When you want to leave immediately! Do you ever have times like those? Well, this book will certainly come in handy, then! It's called “Adventure Rules for Unova's Challenge"! It says here, “Press the X Button to make the RETIRE button appear. Press that to return to the lobby!" Of course, if you choose to retire, your challenge will be considered a failure, so choose wisely! I'm the gate Trainer for this area, so I'll be waiting for you somewhere!
This area is no problem, right? For you guys. I mean, you have your Pokémon with you. Right! Keep on going with your Pokémon! I'll be waiting for you higher up!
This area is no problem, right? For you guys. I mean, you have your Pokémon with you. Right! Keep on going with your Pokémon! I'll be waiting for you down below!
                        
                     
What's that? Yeah, I saw the gate Trainer up above a little while ago.
                                
                         
                          
                                
                             
                        
                     
I saw the gate Trainer down below a bit earlier.
                                
                         
                          
                                
                            
                       
                    
I saw the gate Trainer on this floor a bit earlier.
                               
                        
                         
                                 
                            
                               
                            
                          
                        
                          
                           
                             
                                   
                         
                          
I saw the gate Trainer to the north of here.

You can call me the Judge. Heh heh, that's actually not my real name, but it's what everyone calls me. It's because of this weird power I have. It's a gift, really. I can discern--judge, you might say--the overall potential of individual Pokémon. If you'd like, I could judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon.
If you'd like, I could judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon.
...Oh? You don't need me to judge. I get it.
Judge an Egg?! That's a tall order even for me!
I see, I see... This Pokémon's potential is decent all around. That's my determination, and it's final.
I see, I see... This Pokémon's potential is above average overall. That's my determination, and it's final.
I see, I see... This Pokémon has relatively superior potential overall. That's my determination, and it's final.
I see, I see... This Pokémon has outstanding potential overall. That's my determination, and it's final.
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its HP.
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Attack stat.
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Defense stat.
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Sp. Def stat.
Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Speed stat.
And its Attack stat is also good.
I see. Its Defense stat is also good.
Its Sp. Atk stat is equally good.
Its Sp. Def stat is good as well.
Well, its Speed stat is also good.
It's rather decent in that regard. That's how I judged it.
It's very good in that regard. That's how I judged it.
It's fantastic in that regard. That's how I judged it.
It can't be better in that regard. That's how I judged it.

When you participate alone, you will be joined by other Trainers from around the Unova region. If you want to put on a musical with your friends, go to the left reception area. You'll be asked to pick a Leader who will choose which show to perform, and the others will join the group. The reception area to the right is where you go to Dress Up only.
Eligible Pokémon
The Pokémon that will participate in the musical are chosen from your party at the reception area. Because of their shape, some Pokémon have a hard time wearing certain Props. You might want to try Dress Up in the changing room first if you're worried!
Dress Up
Oh, Dress Up is my favorite part! That's where you put the Props you've collected on the Pokémon that will be performing. Depending on the Pokémon, you can put the Props in different places. When you use Props that fit the theme of the show you've chosen, the audience will notice your Pokémon more! Sometimes a Prop that doesn't fit the theme will also make your Pokémon stand out. If you want to get an idea of how it's done, you can watch how other people Dress Up and then try it yourself!
Shows
You can choose which show to perform when you participate in the musical. There is no need for Trainers to give commands, but if your Pokémon is carrying a Prop in its arms, it can use that Prop to show off and appeal to the audience. Depending on how you Dress Up your Pokémon, the reactions from the audience will change!

Hmmm. VAR(258, 0), is it? That sounds good! It's a very “you" sort of name. But if you'd like to change it, I can help you do that. How about it?
Excellent! What would you like the new nickname to be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as VAR(258, 0)! You're right, that does seem to fit it better. Nicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you change your mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be known as VAR(258, 0)! It looks no different from before, but we both know this name is vastly superior! How fortunate for you!

Cilan: Chili, are you listening to me? We have to study hard and become full-fledged Gym Leaders as soon as possible...
Chili: About that. If we had gone to N's Castle a year ago, the Seven Sages and the Shadow Triad wouldn't have escaped! Then, nobody would say something like “Three of you together make..."
Cress: I guess you're right.
Cilan: You think so? But it isn't that big of a deal. We may not have made it in time, but Team Plasma is still gone.
Chili: Argh! It's because you say things like that. That's why people treat us like a joke! Like it takes all three of us together to make one great Trainer!
Cress: You're overthinking it, but I can't say the possibility is zero.
Cilan: Come on, you two... Don't you think it's a bit strange to get recognition and respect as Gym Leaders just for beating bad guys?
Chili: I understand what you're saying. But if things go on like this, nothing will ever change. Even if we train, the other Gym Leaders will become that much stronger as well.
???: Then... We'll battle you.
Cress: Based on your appearance, you must be the Shadow Triad. But why are you here?
Shadow Triad: We came on a whim... To vent... To pass time... It doesn't matter.
Chili: Three on three! The first one to beat them is the strongest among us!
Shadow Triad: Too easy...
Shadow Triad: These three aren't worth worrying about. We must focus on the other Gym Leaders so that next time they won't get in our way...
Shadow Triad: Well... Lord Ghetsis is waiting. We must catch that Pokémon.
Chili: C'mon! What was that? Come back here and say that again!
Cilan: I mean... They were overwhelmingly strong.
Cress: We have to admit it. The three Leaders of Striaton City make one full-fledged Trainer.
Cilan: You're right. Chili. Cress. I think as long as the three of us act like the Gym Leaders we are now, nothing will ever change.
Chili: I didn't think you would be the first to say that.
Cress: Of course, I, Cress, was thinking about that, too.
Cilan: All right. Let's resign as Gym Leaders and start our training over from the ground up. Then, I'm sure one of us will become a Trainer everyone recognizes as great.
Chili: We're triplets. What we think is the same. So we just have to become as strong as each other, and then we can be Gym Leaders together again!
Cress: OK. So as for the replacement Gym Leader...

Lenora: Why hello, Burgh. What's up? Suffering from artist's block again?
Burgh: Hmm... Bones, perhaps...
Lenora: Bones...? This is a museum, so of course we have bones. What are you looking for? Your next motif?
Burgh: Maybe... Or maybe not... Many Bug-type Pokémon have hard coverings, right? Their so-called exoskeletons. So I don't quite understand bones. Not at all, actually.
Lenora: So, did you think you would understand something about bones if you came here? Sure thing! Make yourself at home! If you'd like, I can have my husband explain them to you.
Burgh: Mmm... Well, for starters, what do bones mean to you?
Lenora: When I was little, my dad worked in a mine, and he would always bring home bones he dug up. I was just a child, but I was brought under the spell of bones. What did the bones look like when they were part of a living being? Why are they shaped the way they are? Things like that captivated me.
Burgh: Oohhh... I kind of understand. I'm also fascinated by the functional, efficient designs of Bug-type Pokémon, such as the shape of their legs.
???: Hey there! What's everyone all gathered up for?
Burgh: What brings you here?
Clay: Found a Fossil in Twist Mountain. I came to have Lenora look at it and see if ya wanted to keep it here or somethin'.
Burgh: Clay. What do bones mean to you?
Clay: Hmm? Well now... No matter who ya are or when ya die, bones are all that'll be left of ya. When ya think about it, it's amazin'. Even if ya die, ya can make money! Some Fossils are worth a lot, ya know!
Lenora: I can't tell if you're kidding, but of course you would think that way. Burgh is trying hard to think about what bones mean to him. Don't be so flippant! So what kind of Fossil have you got there? Let me see.
Clay: Here ya go! Whaddaya think? It's gotta be worth a mint as a specimen or as a collectible! Which is it?
Lenora: Well, I mean this in a good way, but it's an ordinary Fossil. If it isn't worth much as a specimen, you can't sell it for much. But I'm curious about the soil attached to the Fossil...
Burgh: What do you mean?
Lenora: It's very subtle, but it's a bit different from the soil I usually see from Twist Mountain.
Clay: That so? Guess my Twist Mountain still has unlimited potential! All right! I'll keep on diggin' my Clay Tunnel!
Here, Burgh! That plain ol' Fossil's yours! Have a look at it and think about what bones mean to ya.
Burgh: Thank you, Lenora. I guess it's OK that I have my own perspective on what bones mean to me, right?
Lenora: Why not? You, me, Clay... We all have a different way of thinking about what bones mean to us. It would be kind of creepy if we all felt the exact same way, right? Anyway, I feel sorry for this Fossil. It's just resting, minding its own business, and everyone is saying this and that about it.
Burgh: I know. I'll thank this Fossil by using it as a motif for one of my works. See you, Lenora.

Leaving the Prop Case behind... Huh. Did VAR(256, 0) do that accidentally or on purpose? Whatever the reason, there's no doubt that VAR(256, 0) had a great talent for coordinating Pokémon Props!
Open the Prop Case--and voilà! Colorful Props for Pokémon! Aw, yeah! It is time to play Dress Up!
The Top Hat is an elegant Prop that adds class to any Pokémon's head!
How about popping some cute Blue Barrettes on a Pokémon's ears?
The Square Glasses are eye catching. They nicely frame a Pokémon's face!
Maraca, Maraca, Maraca! It's a sharp look for a Pokémon's arm.
The Umber Belt accentuates a waistline! Belts are decorative as well as useful.
Putting a Tie on a Pokémon's body makes it look dignified or charming--or both!
There's nothing to worry about. If VAR(256, 0) comes back, we'll return this trusty Prop Case in a trice.

Iris: Yay! I did it! Haxorus, thank you! I won because of you!
Drayden: Well done, Iris.
Iris: What did you want to talk to me about, Grandpa?
Drayden: Ah yes... I was thinking about the past. I traveled all over the world looking for a successor. I even went to remote places such as the Village of Dragons. That's where I met you, Iris.
Iris: Yep! I was the strongest!
Drayden: Yes. I was surprised. You were one with your Pokémon and battling with so much joy. Just watching you made me smile. Your opponents felt disappointed by their defeat, but at the same time they enjoyed the battle. It was completely natural for me to decide I wanted to make you my successor.
Iris: I'm so glad I came to Unova! There are many different people and so many different Pokémon! And you know what... In the Village of Dragons, people take living alongside Pokémon for granted. I was surprised some people in Unova didn't think that way!
Drayden: I found your reactions to be a breath of fresh air. And as a condition to leave the Village of Dragons, you wanted to broaden your experiences and become the Champion... So as I promised, I've been training you as a Trainer and as a Gym Leader. An order directly from Alder came as I was training you.
Iris: Alder was smiling, though.
Drayden: He lost to N and retrained himself. He asked me to help him with his special training, but it was ghastly. He wanted to become an immense obstacle for you, the new Champion... For that alone, he pushed himself incredibly hard.
Iris: Alder was really, really strong! And even when I felt a bit weak, he encouraged us! He said that even when their backs are against the wall, my Pokémon have an intense look in their eyes. So, that's why I won, but I feel like I still have a lot to learn.
Drayden: Don't forget that feeling. And now, if I may change the subject... When you came to Opelucid City, I gave you those clothes, right?
You're the Champion, now. It's all right to dress up a little.
Iris: Are these new clothes? OK. I'll change into them right now!
Iris: Wooow! It's such a flowing dress!
Drayden: What is important is your mental preparation as the Champion, Iris.
When I was little, Poké Balls didn't exist yet. Sometimes Pokémon would run away from awful Trainers who didn't try to understand them.
Iris: But you were fine, right? I can tell! Your Haxorus loves you very much!
I've already decided! I know what kind of Champion I will be! There's a myth in Sinnoh that says the reason why Pokémon jump out is because they want to thank people. I'm sure that we and Pokémon have helped each other and enriched the world since ancient times. These memories have been engraved in each Pokémon's heart! So, I want Pokémon and people to get closer and closer! As the Champion, I want to tell that to everybody!
Drayden: Good! If anyone can do it, you can.

Elesa: Skyla, can I ask you a favor?
Skyla: Sure, what's up?
Elesa: I've decided I need a PR makeover! I wanted to try out my new ideas with you, Skyla!
Skyla: A PR makeover?
Elesa: That's right! Here's the thing. I make what everyone thinks is cool into a reality, right? Well, I get to do what I want to do, and while being a model may be difficult, most importantly, it's fun! But the hard parts are really hard. I mean, everyone judges me simply based on my appearance. People say that I'm reserved, and that I don't look like the type who would tell jokes!
...
Elesa: So, I've been thinking about it constantly since then!
A sophisticated joke!
How should I put it... My looks suggest that I'm not a lot of fun. But I'll tear down that mistaken image with my own hands! I'll say something silly and give someone an opportunity to call me out, so we can all have a good laugh!
Skyla: Uh... OK...
Elesa: OK, get a load of this! Throw that misbehaving Klink in the clink!
Elesa: Cofagrigus is so cool! Don't you *cough* agree, Gus?
Elesa: You bought those Fossils from Clay? Did you buy them on Clay-away?
Skyla: Elesa... Those are just a bunch of bad puns. Where's the joke?
Elesa: Exactly! If I make bad puns when I'm supposed to be telling a joke, doesn't it give people even more of an opportunity to tease me and start a funny back-and-forth?
Skyla: Um... That's a little too sophisticated for me. Actually, it's really hard to understand.
Elesa: Really? I guess I'll just rethink my fashion first.
Skyla: Sounds good! Hey, as long as we're hanging out, surely you wouldn't mind having a Pokémon battle with me, right?
Elesa: You bet! And don't call me Shirley!
Skyla: Oh, Elesa...

I see!
Yes.
Mmmh!
Well then...
Looking forward to it.
Sensei! You called?
Alder: You're looking well!
Marshal: Hey, I heard you're going back to acting!
Brycen: Indeed! Team Plasma's actions stirred the hearts of the public. People even worry about how to interact with Pokémon. Of course, it's good to think about that relationship, but still...
Alder: Even if you're told to find an answer on your own... It's not exactly an easy thing to do now, is it?
Brycen: That's why... If people can see my bond with my Pokémon when they're watching my movies, it might ease their worries... That was my reasoning...
Marshal: Oh! I get it now! Can't communicate that just by holing up in the Gym and talking to challengers. But, are you gonna be all right? What if you get hurt during filming again?
Alder: Marshal... Brycen has already decided. Sometimes worrying can destroy potential.
Brycen: I'm fine. I have no doubts about my decision. Also, I appreciate Marshal's concern.
I was young... I thought I could do any kind of action scene. So I would put myself in unnecessary danger. I thought this bravery was my value as a person.
So... Instead of trying to communicate something through my acting, I simply sought amazing action. That was how I got hurt.
Marshal: I think I understand. If you seek strength for its own sake, the reason why you wanted it in the first place becomes vague. And you end up desiring victory and nothing else.
Alder: That's why I've also made an important decision. I'm going to resign as Champion!
We in particular need to take another look at what it means to live together with Pokémon. The world at large is still shaken by uncertainty. So I have to show everyone a new hope.
Marshal: Well, if that's what you've decided, Sensei. Even if I argue, that won't change your decision, will it?
Alder: You've grown so much since you sought me out and asked to be my pupil. Could that be it? Did becoming part of the Elite Four help you grow up in its own way?
Marshal: I thought that if I were strong, my Pokémon would become stronger. Maybe I grew up because my Pokémon taught me that this isn't always the case... Well then, will you spar with me?
Brycen: I will observe.
Alder: Thank you. I want to be sure my Pokémon are in top condition to challenge the Trainer who will become the next Champion.
Alder: To strength!
Marshal: To Pokémon!

The Entree Forest connects dreams and reality. People say dreams come true here.
Is there anything you'd like to know about the Entree Forest?
The Entree Forest is a place where dreams come true. When a dreaming Pokémon wakes up in Game Sync, its dream will come true in this forest.
Pokémon that your Pokémon met in its dream will show up in the Entralink in a Forest Clearing. Pokémon in a Forest Clearing will be your friends for sure! If you move the Pokémon to the Deepest Clearing, they will wait for you there.
When your Pokémon wakes up from a dream, please come to this forest.

You can go back to the original world from this place. If you want to go back to the original world, please come back here.
The Funfest Mission will be started. Please wait a moment.
You can go back to your own world from here. Do you want to go back?
Checked your Entree.
Welcome to the Entralink. Hmm? Judging by your expression, you don't seem to know where you are.
This place is called the Entralink... It's a mysterious place that links people. It is also a place where you can hone your skills by helping out nearby adventurers.
...Hmm. It's a bit hard to explain with words. As an adventurer, you should test yourself to learn what it is...
As a start, talk to this Entree to receive a mission. Then deliver your power to it!
Good! You've managed to receive a mission. The first mission is the... Berry search, I see. That should be just the mission for a beginner like you. Cities and routes have places that glow. You should find Berries there. Search carefully! After the mission, come back here, and a new power will be granted... That's it for now. Get going!
Oh, you're back... Whoa! This is wonderful! You've completed the mission! As I promised, you'll receive a new power...not from me, but from this Entree.
Oh, you're back... Hmm... The mission failed, I see... It's a bit difficult in the beginning, so you need to try again and again. You'll get better before too long. Anyway, I'll give you these for your hard work!
As I promised, you'll receive a new power...not from me, but from this Entree.
The Entree gathers wishes from people. These wishes resonate with each other and turn into Pass Powers, which help adventurers.
Go ahead and receive it. Talk to the Entree and receive a Pass Power!
You've received Pass Power(s), I see. Now you've become a real adventurer. Use your Pass Powers to help nearby adventurers! To use a Pass Power, you need a certain number of Pass Orbs. Receive missions from time to time and collect Pass Orbs. That's all from me. It is now up to you what you think and do. I hope you have a wonderful adventure waiting for you...
You can use a Pass Power by tapping the Tag Log on your C-Gear. Tap the green triangle icon in the Tag Log.

The Entralink is an island where adventurers are linked... Meet many adventurers and hone your skills.
Missions test adventurers. Complete these missions and you'll receive helpful things like Pass Orbs and Pass Powers. Talk to the Entree to start a mission, or use Tag Log on your C-Gear to join someone else's mission. You'll gain more power that way.
Pass Powers are mysterious powers. You can register up to three of them in your C-Gear. You use them by aiming at people you pass by with the Tag Log. But you need Pass Orbs to use Pass Powers. You should carry out a mission and collect Pass Orbs.
First, talk to the Entree and accept a mission. Then deliver your wishes to the Entree!
Go ahead! Receive the Pass Power from the Entree!

You'll find more and more types of Funfest Missions you can receive from the Entree as you advance in your adventure. Talking to people or battling other Trainers will give you more mission types. Please listen to other people when they express their wishes.
Raising the Entralink's level gives you new types of Pass Powers. The Entralink level can sometimes go up as you complete a Funfest Mission. The higher the score is, the more likely the level is to go up.
The Entree grows little by little, as if it responds to people's wishes.
Is there anything you'd like to know about participants?
About participants
About collaboration
Cancel
When you start a Funfest Mission, nearby adventurers can participate in the same mission using the Tag Log on their C-Gear. It may take some time before the mission invitations are received. They should wait a little while and check their Tag Logs.
When you have participants in your Funfest Mission, their actions also count as part of your score. In a mission, items are found at the same location for everyone. You may be able to talk to each other to make missions easier for everybody. One more thing. Sometimes you may fail to receive scores from other people. Worlds don't always resonate as they should, it seems.
It seems that the more adventurers you gather, the more power you bring to the Entralink.

Hey, le Trainer fantastique! Want to be part of the experiment of the century? You need two DS systems to play with Poké Transfer! Do you have a second DS system that you can use?
If you decide that you want to play with Poké Transfer sometime, you're welcome to come back and ask me.
I'm sorry! Sumimasen! But you don't have enough space in your PC Box. Please make room for six Pokémon and try again.
OK! But just remember! ¡Muy importante! Once you bring a Pokémon here, you can't send it back. Do you still want to do it?
DS Wireless Communications will be launched.
                              
OK, OK. Come here. Stand right there!
Well, let's begin! Allons-y!
Great! Molto bene!
You're just as skillful as I expected! Poké Transfer is working! But hey, VAR(256, 0), you can't fool me! I bet you can do even better than this. A Trainer of your caliber can make really good use of Poké Transfer!
Wunderbar! Magnifique! Brilliant! Your skill is impressive! This is the very reason why we scientists are doing research! But, VAR(256, 0)! I think a Trainer with your experience can make use of it even more elegantly. Please master your genius handling of Poké Transfer, and show us how it's done!
Great! Greeeeeeat! Poké Transfer is making tremendous progress! Well, it's unbelievable! ¡Es gigante! I owe everything to you! Please assist our research in the future, too! Please feel free to use Poké Transfer anytime you want!
... G... Great! Greeeat! F--a--n--t--a--s--t--i--c! Your handling of Poké Transfer is reeeally exhilarating! Ohhhh, our invention is near completion! Come again very soon! Come again immediately! And please show us even more wonderful handling of Poké Transfer!
Ohhhhhhhh. Any moment! Any moment! Poké Transfer is only one step away from going down in history as a fantastic invention!
VAR(256, 0)! As I thought, my instinct was right... You are a prodigy! A genius! There won't be anyone else who can handle Poké Transfer in such a professional manner. Please use Poké Transfer anytime you want in the future! We will be here any time to continue to do further research! If you want to use Poké Transfer, please let us know!
I put the Pokémon you caught in your PC Box.
But, it seems you could not catch any Pokémon.
Ugh... There seems to be a communication error. I'm afraid you have to try it again!
Hi, hello! You came here. That means you are a visitor? Huh? No? You came all the way here? Ah, you are a Trainer? Are you in the middle of your journey? Ah, this is your Trainer Card?
W-w-what? You! You have all the Gym Badges?!
Great! You may be able to...
Professor Paaaaaark!
Quick, quick!
Oh, there you are!
Professor! Do you have a minute? I think you do. Listen! This kid is a Trainer who has all the Gym Badges. All of them! I am sure this Trainer can operate it!
I have told you many times. This invention is great indeed, but without a professional Trainer...
What? You have the Gym Badges? ALL of them?!
Fantastic! Fantastico!
Yahoooooooooooooooo!
What a great day! Great! Unbelievable! Hi, I am Professor Andrew Park! You! Er...
VAR(256, 0)!
VAR(256, 0)! Are you willing to participate in an ambitious experiment that will make history? This device is called Poké Transfer. It connects...blah blah blah... ...called DS system...meanwhile... ...blah blah...of molecules...and then... ...while evoking...blah blah... ...ergo, energy particles will... ...blah blah...and if the frequency... ...as you see...with faraway Pokémon... ...the Alpha waves...blah blah... ...following which...reach convergence... ...blah blah...spectacular results!
To put it more simply, if you use this device, you may be able to bring Pokémon here from other regions. But just for safety's sake, the Pokémon you're transferring shouldn't be holding anything! So make sure to take their items first.
...So! You!
You are a fantastic Pokémon Trainer! Will you participate in the great experiment of the century? You need two DS systems to use Poké Transfer! We will conduct the experiment with another DS. Is that OK?
Your Pokémon can't be holding items when you transfer them. It's safer that way. In rare cases, there are Pokémon that cannot be transferred, but Professor Park will explain it to you.
With this research of mine, I also want to have an impact on people in the future... people living 100 or 200 years from now!
Here, we are monitoring Poké Transfer. We're keeping a careful eye to make sure all the Pokémon have safe travels!

Loblolly: When I come up with some good designs, please help me again!

I think I've finally designed Décor items so great that people will dream about them! Here! Which one would you dream about?

Well, if you'd like to give me your opinion on my dream Décor, please come back!
Oh, you have impeccable taste! That's it. This Décor is so great that people will dream about it! Your advice was very helpful. Next time I come up with great designs, I'd love to bounce my ideas off you again!
Everybody is talking about Décor they dream about. Do you know it?
Hello! My name is Loblolly, and I'm a Décor designer. I am trying to design Décor items that everybody loves and dreams about. Tables and chairs so great you can't stop thinking about them, even in your sleep... That's the kind of Décor I'm talking about.

Er... Who was I again? ... ... ...Oh, that's right! I am the Move Deleter!
You've come to make me force your Pokémon to forget some moves?
Which Pokémon should forget a move?
Remember me if there are moves that need to be forgotten.
That Pokémon knows only one move, so it can't be forgotten...
What? That's an Egg. No Egg should know any moves.
OK, then. Which move should be forgotten?
Hm! The move VAR(263, 0)? Should that move be forgotten?
It worked perfectly! Your Pokémon has forgotten the move VAR(263, 0) completely.
                    
                
                           
                       
                                                                                             
                                                                                
                          
                            
                          
                               
                     
Which move should VAR(258, 0) remember?
Should the move VAR(263, 1) be remembered?
Give up trying to make VAR(258, 0) remember a move?
VAR(258, 0) remembered the move VAR(263, 1) it had forgotten!
VAR(258, 0) wants to remember the move VAR(263, 1). But VAR(258, 0) can't learn more than four moves. Delete an existing move to make room for VAR(263, 1)?
1, VAR(48642, 20)2, andVAR(48642, 20)... VAR(48642, 20)... VAR(48642, 20)... Ta-da!VAR(48645, 3)VAR(48645, 5) VAR(258, 0) forgot how to use VAR(263, 1). And...
VAR(258, 0) remembered the move VAR(263, 1) it had forgotten!
Give up on making the Pokémon remember VAR(263, 1)?
VAR(258, 0) did not remember the move VAR(263, 1).
VAR(256, 0) handed over one Heart Scale in exchange.
Is it OK to forget the move VAR(263, 0)?
Everybody calls me the reminder girl. I know every move that Pokémon learn while they're leveling up. And I can make Pokémon remember those moves! If you bring me a Heart Scale, I'll make a Pokémon remember a move.
Should a move be remembered?
Which Pokémon should learn it?
If any of your Pokémon needs to remember a move, bring me a Heart Scale!
Eggs can't remember moves!
This Pokémon hasn't forgotten any moves.

Thank you for waiting. We've restored your Pokémon to full health.
We hope to see you again!
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. We restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to...
Th-that Trainer Card! That wonderful shade! That sparkle! I've seen several Trainers with Silver Trainer Cards already... But you're the first to top them all with that impressive Trainer Card. Oh, VAR(256, 0), may I please heal your Pokémon?
Great to see you, VAR(256, 0)! You want the usual, right?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.

Info
I am sorry... You can't enter the Union Room yet.
You have at least one Pokémon that can't be taken in.
Wait, Trainer! Your title on your Trainer Card is still just “Pokémon Trainer," isn't it? If you change your title, you can easily project your image to others when you greet them in the Union Room. Let's see... How about VAR(270, 0)? What do you think? That is the impression I got from you. First, let's change your title. If you don't like the new one, you can change it by selecting your Trainer Card.
It seems you can't use it yet.
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
VAR(256, 0) picked up the Xtransceiver.
Oh? You're...
Sorry... When I saw you, I just started talking for some reason.
I'm sorry! Your system's power was turned off during a Random Matchup! You will not be able to participate in a Random Matchup or Wi-Fi Competition for an hour. Please come back later.
In honor of your achievement in battle, I present you with these Battle Points!
VAR(256, 0) received VAR(513, 1) BP!
Saving... Don't turn off the power.

Yessir, boss! There's no doubt in my mind that this Trainer will become a top star of Pokéstar Studios' silver screen!
I know! Isn't it fabulous?! I am sure you'll be a big star, dahling! So I beg of you! Be in a movie! Today I've even called on an amazing, astounding costar for you!
Brycen! Would you join us?
I'm Brycen... Pleased to meet you...
Brycen is Pokéstar Studios' pride and joy--our marquee star! I've prepared a positively perfect script for a big, veteran star like him and a fresh, new talent like you!
Those eyes... I look forward to acting with you...
Mhm! As cool as ever! So that's the situation! If you talk to that fine staff member over there, you can shoot the film! Don't be afraid of making mistakes! To start with, try going big!
Movies! They're amazement itself! Come now, VAR(256, 0), dahling, be surprised and moved! Try the experience for yourself!
Well now, VAR(256, 0)! Looking forward to working with you! Please do your best until we make a movie to release in the theater!
Great! Good work! That was stirring acting! I can't wait to see the finished film! And this is where we're really amazing! The movie you just filmed... will be finished in an instant! And released on the silver screen! Come now, VAR(256, 0), dahling! Let's be off to the theater!
Hey! Boss! Sorry to interrupt, but the time...
Oh, that's right... Got it...
Boo! So sorry, VAR(256, 0), dahling! I have to hurry off! But, VAR(256, 0), you should go see how your debut turned out! I'm sure it will be an amazing movie. You are in it, after all! Ciao! See you again soon! Pokéstar Studios is always waiting for you, VAR(256, 0)!
Pokéstar Studios... This is a stage of dreams that only chosen Trainers can stand on! Please finish the procedures for filming with the gentleman by the door...

Welcome to Pokéstar Studios. How may I help you?
This is where the movies developed at the film studio are released. You'll find a monitor in the movie theater to check the records of these movies.
Please select the movie you'd like to watch.
I apologize. We have no movies available to show. I wonder if anyone would be interested in helping to create new movies, hmm...
The movie is about to begin. Please enjoy.
Please come again!
This monitor is currently being tested.
Well, well! If it isn't VAR(256, 0), dahling!
VAR(256, 0)--this particular effort turned out to be... ...a complete flop, dahling. But I thought it was quite a unique little film in its own way. I liked it!
VAR(256, 0), this time your movie turned out to... ...exceed everyone's expectations! Everybody's talking about it, dahling. With an amazing film like this, movie buffs--and our staff--will definitely notice you, VAR(256, 0)!
VAR(256, 0)--this particular effort turned out to be... ...a spec-tac-ulah hit, dahling! Keep it up, and you'll be loved by movie buffs everywhere--and our staff.
Dahling, VAR(256, 0), I must tell you... Your Pokémon that performed in this movie may be showing more acting chops than before.
Bye for now, VAR(256, 0)! I'm so looking forward to your next picture, dahling!
Here we are! This is the reception area.
Oh, if it isn't the scout himself! Thanks to you, I've made my movie debut!
Wow! I'm glad to hear that!
And who would that be?
This is VAR(256, 0)! I witnessed this Trainer challenging your daughter. It struck me--here's someone with real potential! A fresh discovery for Pokéstar Studios!
You beat Roxie, I see. You must be a pretty good Trainer. Oh, you know what? They're releasing my movie now! Are you thinking about making a Pokéstar Studios debut, too? Then, I do insist you watch my movie in order to gain acting tips from a professional such as myself.
That's a good idea! VAR(256, 0), it should be a good introduction to filmmaking for you!
Awesome! Let's go!
Welcome to the Pokéstar Studios theater. This is the reception counter.
This is where you choose the movie you want to watch. There are eight screens in the theater here in Pokéstar Studios! Pretty impressive, huh? Now... Huh? It seems my movie will be shown on a special screen.
...
I hope you had a good time! How did you enjoy the movie?
...
What's the matter?
Ha ha ha. I've always dreamed of making my debut on the silver screen... Now I've fulfilled that dream...
What are you saying?
Different people have different talents. I knew it all along. But I see my daughter striving to balance the responsibility of being a Gym Leader while pursuing her own dream of being in a band. Although I'm a father, I really wanted to pursue my own long-held dream... If you stop pursuing your dreams, your life might as well be over, right?
...
I'm going back to my duties as a ship captain for now. Someday, I'll return to the screen! Until that day comes, I'll leave all the starring roles to you!
We had better get going. Mr. Deeoh should be ready by now.

Is your Pokémon's HP all right? If there's room in your Bag, I'll give you this. Put it in your Bag's Medicine Case.
When your Pokémon's HP decreases, they no longer have the energy to fight. So, don't push your Pokémon too hard, and let them rest often.
Two years ago, a Trainer from Nuvema did some amazing things, including battling Team Plasma and saving Unova! I was the one who told that Trainer that wild Pokémon are hiding in the tall grass. And that you can battle or capture wild Pokémon there! So, you could say that I'm one of the people who saved Unova, too!

Bianca: Heeey!
Bianca: Hi there!
I have fond memories of this place...
One day... VAR(256, 1), Cheren, and I all gathered right here and took the first step of our adventure. It's a very special spot.
Bianca: Hey, VAR(256, 1)! Let's all take our first step on Route 1 together!
One, two!
Ha ha! That's what I said. Hey, while we're here, have a Pokémon battle with me! Talking about VAR(256, 1) put me in the mood for a Pokémon battle!
Tee-hee! You're so tough! You're just like VAR(256, 1)! OK! I just have to remember what I felt like back then and work hard, too! Thanks! See you!

This electric bulletin board has been pitch black for a really long time.
One thing I learned during my travels is that home is a really nice place, too! Funny--before I set off, I absolutely couldn't wait to leave...
My Pokémon just love to battle! I'm absolutely worn out... So I'm resting here...

What could be the perfect instrument for me? For example... I want a strong impact-- an impact as strong as a Pokémon with a tough Ability like Solid Rock that reduces the power of supereffective moves! If you have a Pokémon like that, please show it to me!
Th-that VAR(257, 0)... That Ability is Solid Rock! VAR(257, 0) is as hard as a rock! And has a rocking heart! In other words, it has an impact that rocks those who see it! Solid Rock... Like a hard rock... Hard rock?! Could that be the sound I've been looking for? At any rate, thanks! Take this, OK?
Oh, you can't fit any more in your Bag.
What is this feeling coursing through my veins?
Jugga jya jaaaan! Deedley deeedly deeedly deeedly, meedley meedley meedley meedley, MEEEEEEE! Yeeeeah! Your VAR(257, 0)'s hard-rockin' Ability opened my eyes! Juggah juggah jah! Duddah daaaaaah, bwan! That's it! I should join Roxie's band! I could rock out with her! Dual guitars! Awesome!
Know what? You know the guy at the ledge on Route 19? He's my rival!
My Pokémon aren't feeling well, so I'm not walking in the tall grass. Oh, wait... You have eight Badges! Eep! I'm so embarrassed! You already know this stuff! I shouldn't try to show off!
Battles between Pokémon Trainers are serious affairs you can't run from! I mean, more than anything, you can't run away from other Trainers in front of your beloved Pokémon!

Pokémon Trainer! Do you have a Pokémon Egg?
Wow! It's a Pokémon Egg! It feels sort of warm! A Pokémon will hatch from this, right?
Teacher says that lies lead to a life of crime!
Aww... The old guy next door said he didn't know when they'd find another Egg... But I really want to see one!
Sometimes they let my big brother play together with Pokémon, too!
Don't you have a Bicycle? Can you even ride one?

Pokémon Trainers sure are good at meeting Pokémon.

Hey, Trainer! These boulders suddenly lined up like this... What's more, the HM Strength won't budge them.
I never would have guessed they were Crustle... If you're interested in Crustle, you'll find them in the Desert Resort, which is just past here!
It's a big boulder, but it doesn't look like a Pokémon can move it...
Colress: I've been waiting for you! What's the matter? Interested in what's behind me?
These are not mere rocks, but the Pokémon known as Crustle. Observe. With this device I created to energize Pokémon, I'll...
      
Colress: Those Crustle... Were they just lying here, out of energy, with their boulders on their backs?
Team Plasma said we should recognize the potential in Pokémon and liberate them from humans. I disagree. Conversely, it should be humans who bring out the hidden potential in Pokémon!
Now that I think of it, I never asked your name. ... ... VAR(256, 0)... I'll remember that name. Well then, I will test you to see if you're a Trainer who can bring out the hidden potential of Pokémon!
Colress: I see! Just like the Gym Leaders in each area or the Elite Four and Champion in the Pokémon League, you bring out the power in Pokémon by being kind to them! That's the kind of person you are. I'm extremely grateful for your help. This is a token of my gratitude.
Colress: It's so frustrating! If only we could talk to Pokémon in order to bring out their power! But there's no way a person like that could ever exist! Well then, VAR(256, 0), I hope to see you again sometime.
Awwwwk!
Mandibuzz flew off into the sky...
Places with ruins are being developed one after another. We end up losing parts of our history...
The Relic Castle is being buried in sand... Someday, memories of it may be buried, too.
Oh! Trainer, when you see sand... Do you notice how some areas are lighter? And some of the sand looks...darker... Pokémon are hiding in the darker sand!
Route 4
Trainer Tips!  Pokémon have a source of energy for using moves. It's called PP, meaning Power Points. They have PP for each move. When a move has no PP remaining, that Pokémon cannot use that move. That's a good time to head for the Pokémon Center!

I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. Now, I'm having a Triple Battle with the opponent in front of me!
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I wanted to get the attention of a girl I like, so I mastered a new style of Pokémon battling called Triple Battle. Want to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is really hard.
In Triple Battles, you send out three Pokémon at a time and battle! The rules are simple: just make all of your opponent's Pokémon faint. And that's a rough explanation of Triple Battles.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. Hey! If you're a Trainer, how about a Triple Battle?
You've got a good attitude, don't you! I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I'm always at full throttle.
I hate to burst your bubble when you're all fired up, but... In Triple Battles, you need three or more Pokémon to battle.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I have some advice for you. Challenge is the essence of life!
Sheesh. That's embarrassing. Getting schooled when I was planning to teach. Still, you have potential! You have to understand your Pokémon to win in a Triple Battle.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. Riding a bike and becoming the wind fits a bad boy like me.

I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. I wanted to get the attention of a girl I like, so I mastered a new style of Pokémon battling called Rotation Battle. Want to learn about it?
Oh, man! Getting someone's attention is really hard.
In Rotation Battles, you send out three Pokémon at a time and battle! One Pokémon takes the lead position, and the other two stand on each side. The trick is, each turn you can change their positions... And that's a rough explanation of Rotation Battles.
I'm a heartbreaker... My name... Charles. Hey! If you're a Trainer, how about a Rotation Battle?

Am I going to lose to the heartbreaker? I have a girlfriend!
You have four Gym Badges... You might be able to defeat Charles! Please beat him for me!
Because it's a battle, one person has to win and one person has to lose. I wish my boyfriend could just enjoy the battle and not worry about losing. Sometimes he gets too serious.
There seems to be a lot to think about, but it looks really fun!
Battling with three Pokémon. That itself makes me very excited!
Triple Battle and Rotation Battle... There are various styles of Pokémon battling.
The Trainer called Charles is quite tough to beat. If you have four Gym Badges, you might be a match for him.
There are so many different Pokémon, it's difficult to decide which ones to battle with.
There are a lot of Pokémon. So I like this!
Looking at this kind of battle makes me curious about the Pokémon World Tournament. I hear it will be held in Driftveil City.
Hi, Trainer! Will you buy the Berries I gathered? Five VAR(265, 0) for just $200! You want them. You'll buy them, right?
Boo! And I went to all that trouble to gather Berries.
Five VAR(265, 0) for $200! You're a smart shopper!
Oh! But your Bag is full!
Oh! But you don't have enough money.
I'll keep gathering Berries. Come back tomorrow if you want more!
I'll sell you five VAR(265, 0) for just $200. You want them. You'll buy them, right?
The drawbridge goes up when a ship needs to pass. Then, the Pokémon that are resting on the bridge fly away all at once!
Hum fiercely! My battle song! Battle fiercely! My Pokémon! Huh? You don't have a Prop Case, do you? Then I won't battle you!
Hum fiercely! My battle song! Battle fiercely! My Pokémon!
In battling you, I came to understand... You're the best! Here! This is for you!
If you want your Pokémon to hold this Electric Guitar, go to the Musical Theater! Cooler than cool!
In battling you, I came to understand... You're the best! After all, you have the Electric Guitar Prop!
In hot summer, I want to cool down with Water-type Pokémon. On the other hand, in cold winter, I want to warm up with Fire-type Pokémon.
A Pokémon you are proud of wins with your favorite move! That's when a Trainer definitely smiles.

Ta-da! It's a Hidden Machine, Fly! When you use this move outside of battle, you can go to places you want to go, like a Pokémon Center. By the way, VAR(256, 0), do you know about Hidden Grottoes?
Ta-da! It's a Hidden Machine, Fly! When you use this move outside of battle, you can go to places you want to go, like a Pokémon Center. By the way, VAR(256, 0), do you know about Hidden Grottoes?
Great! You might find one soon!
OK! Then I'll explain! Sometimes you can find a grotto among trees where Pokémon like to hide. That place is called a Hidden Grotto. Makes sense, right?
Wait! ...
Over there! I heard something from that direction! I have good ears. Hey! Come with me!
The sound is coming from somewhere around here.
Wow! Here it is! There's a gap, and it looks like we can fit through! C'mon! Let's go have a look!
Look! You've found a narrow path! Will you follow it?
This is too good to pass up! Let's go in!

Trainer Tips!  There are different Cases for each type of item. Items are placed automatically in the correct Case by their type. The name of the Case tells you what type of items will be kept there. Also, you can place anything in Free Space, no matter what it is. So you can keep items you often use in one place.
Cheren: I heard that you met a Pokémon Trainer called N. That's not really why I'm here, though. Will you battle me?
Cheren: There's something I want to check by having a battle with you. How about it?
You remind me of VAR(256, 1). That makes me excited about this Pokémon battle!
Not interested? Well, I'll be here, so when you change your mind, please come battle me.
I talked with VAR(256, 1) here before. We all have our own brand of strength, people and Pokémon both. The strength to make our dreams a reality, the strength to protect what we hold most dear... That's what I said.
I was thinking about how I hope N can see the same thing...but during our battle, I came to understand something. During his journey, N also saw what we saw. If I tell this story, VAR(256, 1) will probably be happy. Thank you!
You were great! Charles, too. He was great to some extent, I guess!
Three Pokémon!
Love!
Good, good, good.

Kawbraa!
Rood: That Pokémon...?
Elderly Man: It's the legendary Pokémon called Cobalion! I told you the story the other day, right?
Rood: Oh, Cobalion! What a noble presence!
Elderly Man: They say the three Pokémon Cobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion fought against people to protect Pokémon from the war those people started...
When people fight, there's no peace for Pokémon, either. The three legends learned that the deeds of humans could lead to dire consequences for their world.
But... Why did it show up in front of people?
Is it patrolling the Unova region to protect Pokémon because it fears for their safety after the commotion caused by Team Plasma two years ago? Or does it sense a new problem...?
Rood: Unforgivable... So the reach of Ghetsis's ambition and malice is growing ever wider and warping the lives of all it touches...
Did Cobalion appear in front of you merely by accident? Or to plead with you to solve a problem? Unlike Lord N, I don't have the ability to understand the minds of Pokémon. Therefore, I don't know what that Pokémon is thinking. But if you can befriend Cobalion, it will be a great asset to you on your journey.
Not just people and Pokémon... It's best for all creatures to accept and trust one another...
Chargestone Cave is great! The Ferroseed I met here were absolutely adorable!

Cheren: No one really talks about it, but the record shows that there was a sudden drop in temperature near Lacunosa Town. It was only for a moment, but it went down as low as -58° F.
Not only that, but similar temperatures were recorded around Castelia City and Driftveil City.
On top of that, that incident with Team Plasma! I think this needs some investigation before things go bad. I hate cold weather, though.
I'll give you this... It's a Hidden Machine that contains Surf. With this, please go to different places and check what's going on. Let one of your Pokémon learn Surf, and you can travel across the water.
Sorry to have slowed you down. Some strange things may be happening, so be careful on your journey!
This is the Season Research Lab. Twist Mountain, just beyond Mistralton, has snow, depending on the season.
Some Pokémon change their appearance depending on the season. Could that also be considered a type of evolution?
You can see Deerling from all four seasons in our lab! When it comes to Deerling, we're sort of the experts. We found a rather rare Deerling. Will you raise it for us? What do you say?
Here you are! Take good care of it!
VAR(256, 0) received Deerling!
Give a nickname to the Deerling you received?
You're traveling with lots of Pokémon already!
Are you sure? It's quite a rare Deerling, you know!

How did you enjoy my Pokémon weather forecast? Please bring me a Pokémon with other moves or Abilities if you want to hear a different forecast!
Oh, my! None of the Pokémon traveling with you have moves or Abilities that change the weather. If you find one that does, bring it to me. I'll give you a Pokémon weather forecast!
My Pokémon weather forecast for you! Well, that's how it normally goes, but... Your VAR(257, 0)'s Ability is none other than VAR(262, 2)! That's a problematic one for me. Since VAR(262, 2) turns off the effects of weather, it means my Pokémon weather forecast isn't too helpful!
Is today a special day for some reason? It feels like my mind has cleared up... as if a fog has lifted! Maybe the weather somewhere is cleared up just like my mind...
Here comes a question out of a clear sky! Have you heard of diamond dust? It's a breathtaking phenomenon that is created by shiny icy particles coming down from the sky!

Long ago, I was a sharp-lookin' young man, and my wife was a fine-lookin' girl. This is a story from way back then. Right around here, a certain Pokémon taught Tornadus and Thundurus a lesson. For about 30 years after that, those two Pokémon kept it calm and quiet.

Hmm!
Wow! Wow! What an awesome Trainer! That Pokémon you are traveling with is Landorus in Therian Forme!
A long, long time ago... Tornadus and Thundurus started a rampage in Therian Forme. When everybody thought the Unova region would be ruined and gave up hope, Landorus, also in Therian Forme, appeared out of nowhere and stopped them. That's what they say.
Oh! Hey! Wait a second.
This has been placed in the shrine. Take this.
They say the Reveal Glass brings Thundurus, Tornadus, and Landorus back to their original appearance. However, I don't know whether Incarnate Forme or Therian Forme is the true Forme.
Why do delicious vegetables grow in the fields of Mistralton City? It's because the ones who grow them are very picky about the mulch they use. It's good mulch. Strong mulch. It's stored up a lot of energy from nature. And that makes it really stinky! Such a powerful aroma! It burns all the way to the back of your nose! Aww. Just remembering it makes me dizzy!
The Funfest Mission “VAR(320, 0)" has been added to the Entralink.
Stinky, stinky mulch grows delicious vegetables!
So you know what Landorus is like when it means business, huh?
Yeah! I do! It changes into another Forme and flies around the sky! Tornadus and Thundurus change Formes, too! ...Well, that's the story, anyway.
Yeah! I do! It changes into another Forme and flies around the sky! Thundurus and Tornadus change Formes, too! ...Well, that's the story, anyway.
That's good, then! ...You know, I've only heard about it in stories, too.
                                                                                                        
                                                                        
           
This little shrine is dedicated to a Pokémon called Landorus. They say that when Tornadus and Thundurus were whipping up storms that damaged houses and fields all over the Unova region, Landorus made them stop. That's a story from when my grandpa was just a little kid!

Oh my... Don't you know anything of the world? It may trick you.
It's your choice to trust it and be tricked, or to live in doubt. I enjoyed talking with you. This is a small present.

OK, here's how it works. The Pokédex's pages fill up automatically when you meet Pokémon! And when you catch a Pokémon, more detailed information on it is added to the Pokédex! Here, I'll show you how to catch a Pokémon! Starting...NOW!
Bianca: What a relief! I caught a Pokémon! Oh! Um... Right. I'll go over the important stuff. First, go find a healthy Pokémon to catch! You need to remember this next bit! It's best to lower the Pokémon's HP before you try to catch it. Use your Pokémon's moves to lower the HP of the Pokémon you want to catch. Making it fall asleep or paralyzing it will make it even easier to catch!
You're going to go deliver the Town Map to your friend, right?
Continue straight this way to get to Floccesy Town!
Bye now! Meet lots of Pokémon and catch a lot of them, OK?
???: You there, Trainer!

Excuse me! I forgot to tell you something important! First, take these!
Those are Oran Berries! If you give one to your Pokémon, its HP will be restored.
What's more! You can give your Pokémon a Berry to hold! Like this Oran Berry, for instance. When a Pokémon holds this Berry, it can eat the Berry if it gets hurt in the heat of battle and regain some of its lost HP!
Well... I just told you to challenge the Gym Leader. Aspertia's Gym Leader is a very strong Pokémon Trainer! But you have nothing to worry about! If you think hard about what the Pokémon at your side can do, and what you should do as a Trainer, victory will be yours!
And then you should take on stronger and stronger Trainers... Actually, take on the Gym Leaders of each city! Working together with your Pokémon is what makes you grow as a Trainer. As you and your Pokémon grow stronger, your world will get broader!

The one radiating such a tremendous presence before you is none other than Terrakion!
Colress: It's been a long time. Terrakion is one of the three Pokémon who protected Pokémon from the flames of a human conflict!
It seems likely that Terrakion has picked up the scent of danger that emanates from Team Plasma. It's probably seeking a Pokémon Trainer who has the strength to stand up to them.
It's very interesting indeed that Terrakion appeared before you! That aside, do you plan to confront Team Plasma?
I see. If that's the case, you must have the power to protect your own Pokémon! Being protected by Pokémon alone doesn't make you a Trainer! It's because Trainers are strong, because they care about their Pokémon, that these Pokémon can also be strong! Here! This is from me!
I see! That works as well. You and your Pokémon can proceed down your own path! What you should do is care about your Pokémon to bring out their power to its fullest potential! Here! This is from me!
This is a prototype of my device that energizes Pokémon! It doesn't work on battling Pokémon, but you may find it useful for something! Well then, I wish you and your Pokémon a safe journey!

Hilbert: I heard about VAR(313, 1) and decided to visit.

Well. I'm curious about places to help Pokémon grow.
I want to blow off some steam, so I'll tell you exactly where I want to go. A Café! A Flower Shop! A Nursery! A Beauty Salon! A Dojo! Know where I can find these shops?
Mm-hmm... I want to go somewhere beautiful and quiet that makes me feel like painting.
I feel like going to a shop where a dazzlingly cute girl works.
I want to go diggin' for treasure. Or maybe see about winnin' a prize.
I just want to shop!
M'hm... Well. I'd like you to take me to a place you recommend.
Now I feel like going to a place run by a very energetic man!
    
    
Thanks! Then, I'll go there.
Thanks! I'm going to have a blast!
Mm-hmm... I'm off, then.
I'm sure the girl is shining!
You think so, huh? OK. I'll check it out.
OK!
Hmm! Then, I'll go have a look.
I see. Then, I'll go there!
Then, I'm off to the place you suggested.

Roxie: Oh, sorry! This just isn't what I want today!
Burgh: M'hm. This is a bit...different.
Elesa: Sorry. This place lacks sparkle.
Clay: Not yet. This shop can grow more! I'll come back then.

OK! Well, if you change your mind, come again, OK?
Let me see... Well, this Pokémon can learn the move, but you need to have a really strong bond of friendship first. I don't think I can teach it yet.
OK, great! Oh, but... You don't seem to have a Pokémon that can learn this move.
OK, great! Which Pokémon should learn this move?
Um... I'm sorry... That Pokémon can't learn this move!

VAR(258, 0) learned VAR(263, 2)!
Drayden: If you wish, I can teach your Pokémon the strongest Dragon-type move. Would you like your Pokémon to learn that move?
Understood. Come again if you change your mind.
Hmm... This Pokémon can learn this move, but your bond of friendship is not yet strong enough. That means I cannot teach it this move.
I see... But there are no Pokémon with you right now that can learn this move.
Which Pokémon should learn this move?
I'm very sorry, but... This Pokémon cannot learn this move.
That's an interesting request, but... Not even I can teach a move to an Egg.
Hmm... It looks like this Pokémon already knows VAR(263, 0).
Drayden: Draco Meteor's power is exceptional, but using it lowers the user's Sp. Atk stat.
Your quest for power has brought you here... Very well. Let me reward your passion with some absolutely astounding moves. They're the ultimate moves! Shall I teach them to your Pokémon?
                              
The Pokémon with you can't learn these moves! Go talk to my wife! Keh!!
Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well. Visit if you have a change of heart.
Well, which Pokémon should I teach?
That Pokémon can't learn a move! Go talk to my wife! Keh!
Teach a move to an Egg? Impossible, even for me! Keh!
The bond with your Pokémon is not strong enough! Keh!
That Pokémon already knows that move! Keh!
I should teach VAR(263, 1) to VAR(257, 0), right? Keh!
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Heya! The professor gave you a Pokémon to start your journey, right? If that Pokémon is still with you, and if you two have a strong bond, there's a special move it can learn... Want me to teach it a battle-combo move?
A special move... Should I teach it a battle-combo move?
I can't teach these Pokémon.
Is that so... Well, come on back now, y'hear?
Which Pokémon should learn the move?
Now, that Pokémon can't learn this special move! I told ya, it's only for the Pokémon who started your journey with you.
Teach a move to an Egg? What kinda crazy talk is that?!
This Pokémon... Well, it doesn't look like it's too comfortable with you yet.
I can't teach it twice. This Pokémon already knows the special move!
Want me to teach VAR(263, 1) to VAR(257, 0)?
The Pokémon I've taken a shine to are the ones you get from the professor! To teach all of these Pokémon a special move, a battle-combo move... That's my pledge!
I'm the master Move Tutor! And I'm also obsessed with VAR(265, 0)! Give me VAR(265, 0), and I'll thank you by teaching your Pokémon a move!
I'm the master Move Tutor!
Want me to teach your Pokémon a move?
Well, that's just fine! Pick the move you want me to teach!
If you collect some VAR(265, 0), you come back now.
VAR(256, 0) handed over VAR(513, 2) VAR(265, 1) in exchange.
This Pokémon can't learn that move!
This Pokémon already knows that move!

Ah, it's you! We were raising your Pokémon, and my goodness, were we surprised! Your Pokémon was holding an Egg! We don't know how it got there, but your Pokémon had it. You do want it, don't you?
VAR(256, 0) received the Egg from the Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
You have no room for it right now... Come back when you've made room.
I really will keep it. You do want this Egg, yes?
Well then, I'll hang on to it. Thanks!
I'm the Day-Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. Would you like us to raise your Pokémon?
I'm the Day-Care Lady. We can raise Pokémon for you. What do you want to do today?
Very good. Come again.
Ah, there you are! My husband was looking for you.
You can't leave your only Pokémon with me! How would you battle? Come back another time.
Which Pokémon should we raise for you?
Now, now. That is merely an Egg!
Fine, we'll raise your VAR(258, 0) for a while.
Come back for it later.
We can raise two of your Pokémon. Would you like us to raise another?
You have energetic Pokémon. Do you want your Pokémon back?
By level, your VAR(257, 0) has grown by about VAR(513, 1).
If you want your VAR(257, 0) back, it will cost $VAR(516, 1). Do you want it back?
You don't have enough money...
VAR(256, 1) took VAR(257, 0) back from the Day-Care Lady.
Do you want to take back the other one, too?
Huh? Now, now. If you leave that Pokémon with me, you'll be left with just one. You will be better off if you catch some more, if I do say so myself.

You're VAR(256, 0)?
I knew it! You look just like her!
Come now! Don't say that! My eyes are actually quite sharp!
I know your mom! I met her when she was working at the Pokémon Center and I was a Trainer. That's right! How are your Pokémon? You're always welcome to let them rest here!
My, now how are your Pokémon? Let them rest here for a moment!
Great! You and your Pokémon look raring to go!
Pokémon work so hard to help you out! Be sure to be kind to them, OK!
No news is good news they say. Being happy about something like that is a little difficult though. Being a parent is tough.
Maybe I should go on a journey to go find my child! Oh, but I would feel really bad if they stopped by while I was gone.
I sure wish you two could meet!

If you have a Permit, you can fly from Mistralton City and go to the Nature Preserve! I won't spoil the surprise about what kind of place it is.
I have no idea why, but when you hold an Oval Charm, it's more likely that a Pokémon Egg will be found at the Day Care!
Somehow, when you hold the Shiny Charm, shiny Pokémon pop out of the tall grass more often than usual.

Wow! Amazing! VAR(257, 0) is so tiny! I wonder what it would feel like to become VAR(257, 0)... I bet I'd get a way different outlook on life... Just imagining it gets me excited! Tiny things are super interesting!
Hm... You don't even have a teensy number of tiny Pokémon. I'd sure like to see a Pokémon that's eight inches high or smaller...
Thanks for showing me a tiny Pokémon! It was super interesting! I'd sure like it if you'd show me one again tomorrow...
You know what?! I love high places like this, and really big things! My favorite Pokémon are big ones, too! What I mean by big, you know, is being more than 17 feet tall! C'mon! If you have a big Pokémon, show it to me!
Have you come to show me a big Pokémon?
Wow! Amazing! VAR(257, 0) is sooooo big! Riding on top of VAR(257, 0) would be so much fun! When you look from high places, you can see rooftops and faraway mountains and other things you usually can't see. That's why I like big things so much!

Zekrom was revived from a rock called the Dark Stone. Let's suppose the meteorite from the story and this stone are one and the same...

Bianca: If your theories are true, it should be a really strong Pokémon. What kind of a reason would there be for it to come out only at night? Like, if, like, it doesn't like sunlight or something like that...
Until we look into it more deeply, it would be hard to say anything about that. Now that I think about it, the name “Lacunosa" could be derived from lacunosus clouds, which are clouds that resemble a net or a fence. I wonder if the name is related to the part of the story where they built walls to protect the town from that Pokémon.
Sorry, I rambled on a bit, didn't I? VAR(256, 0), could you ask Drayden about this, if you get a chance? I'm going to do a little fieldwork. Bianca, help out, OK!
Bianca: Sure thing!
Oh, just so you know, Opelucid City's mayor, Drayden, wrestles with his Pokémon to toughen them up!
Professor Juniper, wait up!
VAR(256, 1): What's up? Have you seen Team Plasma anywhere around here? I heard a rumor to that effect...
Zinzolin: Oh, for crying out loud... This is troublesome indeed, my curious Trainers. Perhaps I should satiate your curiosity somewhat. The reason I am still part of Team Plasma is this: I want to know how the world will change. Listen. Pokémon are nature. Poké Balls are civilization. Humans who are used to civilization don't relinquish it easily. Of course, both nature and civilization are important. But what will happen to a world taken over by Team Plasma? People will be forced to throw out Poké Balls--a product of civilization. I want to know what that looks like! And I want to enjoy it!
VAR(256, 1): Shut your mouth. All I want is to get back a stolen Pokémon! VAR(256, 0)! Give me a hand! You ready?
VAR(256, 1): Just to let you know... You're about to feel my rage!
VAR(256, 1): Got it! Go get ready and then come back here! Being careful against opponents like these isn't a bad thing!
VAR(256, 1): Are you ready to pitch in? OK, let's go!
Team Plasma: What's with these two? I'm battling alongside Zinzolin! This shouldn't be happening!
Zinzolin: These Trainers remind me of that one from two years ago. More important, we must continue our search. Like that scientist said, it might be in Opelucid City! We'll play with you again later!
VAR(256, 1): Get back here!
Do you want to hear that old tale of Lacunosa Town again? It always takes me a little time to tell it.
There's a great big hole behind this town. A long time ago, a huge meteorite fell from the sky and made the big hole. A very scary monster was hiding inside the meteorite! People say the monster appeared in the village at night, with a freezing wind, and it stole away people and Pokémon... So the villagers built big walls to keep the monster out and made a rule that no one could go out after dark.
Whether you believe it or not is up to you... But even now, the people of this town stay inside after dark. The old stories and legends continue to influence our lives.
Oh, fine, fine. Come back again when you have time.
Welcome to Lacunosa Town. In this town, people live as methodically as clockwork from morning to night. If you live your life soaking up sunlight, you can sleep very well at night.
Lacunosa Town Methodical and Orderly for Safety
The big scary monster that comes out at night is a Pokémon, right? It must be a really scary Pokémon if everyone believes the legend and follows these rules...
My granny loves old stories! I'm always having to listen to her really, really long stories.
My grandma's stories were really about Kyurem, it seems. I guess old stories sometimes have a kernel of truth to them.
There are a lot of people in the world, and there are just as many different characteristics and ideas.
I don't have anything to do ever since I took a post here. Since nobody goes outside at night, it's very peaceful.
So the reason nobody goes outside at night and it's so peaceful is because of a Pokémon? I don't know how to feel about that!
Gahoo! Gahoo!
My Pokémon just runs around on its own. Maybe it doesn't need a Trainer?

This is Lacunosa Town. Here, everyone lives according to the rules, from the moment they awaken to the time they go to sleep.
The scary monster that comes out of the big hole at night is actually a Pokémon right? Adults were just saying that to frighten children, huh?

You must be the ones who want to hear that old tale about Lacunosa Town.
Professor Juniper: That's right. Please tell us.
Behind Lacunosa Town, there's a mighty big hole. Have you heard of the Giant Chasm?
Bianca: Oh, I've heard that around the Giant Chasm, there have been brief temperature readings of -58° F! That's what Cheren told me, anyway!
Professor Juniper: The road is blocked, so we can't get there right now...
A long, long time ago, the Giant Chasm was created when a big meteorite fell from the sky. A really scary Pokémon was hidden inside that meteorite...
Professor Juniper: A meteorite...
When darkness falls over the land, this Pokémon appears. A frigid wind follows it. It freezes everything around and eats people and Pokémon... That's why everyone was afraid.
Bianca: The Pokémon ate p-people?
So our ancestors surrounded the town with walls, to prevent the Pokémon from getting inside the town. Also, a rule was made forbidding anyone to go outside after dark. ...And that's the end of the old tale!
Professor Juniper: A fascinating story! I'll add it to my research records.
Everyone, we should be going.
That's sure a scary-sounding Pokémon, even in an old folktale.
Zzz... Zzz... ...Wh-what? What do you want, now? Did you pick now to listen to my stories?
Mmm... OK, I'll tell you... Behind our Lacunosa Town, there's a big hole in the ground. That hole, way in the past... Aaaahhh, I'm so tired... That hole, there was a...a big... crashed down...inside was... big, scary...really scary... Zzz... Zzz... Zzz...
Aaaahhh... Oh, I should... OK, I'll sleep, then... Goodni... Zzz... Zzz... Zzz...
My grandma loves old stories! I'm always having to listen to her really long stories. But sometimes if it's night, she'll fall asleep right in the middle of a story. It's OK, though. She's not only healthy, she's a free-spirited grandma, too!

My work always keeps me very busy, so I'm thrilled if I can go home at night. I'm sorry to leave my wife lonely, but that's the life of a powerful executive. Oh, this is a souvenir from a business trip. She does not seem to need it, so I will give it to you.
Tomorrow it's work as always! I'm a super businessman, aren't I?

VAR(256, 1): Wait up!
Let's see how well we've raised our Pokémon!
VAR(256, 1): Great! If we're this strong, Team Plasma will run screaming when they see us!
I won't let 'em get away, though! Her Purrloin... I'll get it back for sure!
So, VAR(256, 0)! Keep helping me out! Also, continue to work hard on the Pokédex! You're the one who was officially asked to complete it, after all!
VAR(256, 1): What?! It isn't like I came here because I heard rumors about Cynthia being here and I wanted to challenge her or anything... I was interested in the Abyssal Ruins! See! Here's proof! You can have it!
VAR(256, 1): It's Dive! If you have a Pokémon that knows it, you can dive to the ocean floor. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have found my sister's Purrloin... Or should I say her Liepard...
OK! VAR(256, 0)! Let's see who are Aspertia's strongest Pokémon!
Go get 'em, guys!
What's the deal? Don't act all cool.
VAR(256, 1): VAR(256, 0)... I'm really glad you're my friend!
Undellaaaaa!
The Pokémon World Tournament... I wonder if Cynthia will participate, too.
Cynthia is participating in the Pokémon World Tournament! I have to cheer for her!
The Riches moved far away, and it's a little bit lonelier around here.
The sunlight is strong... Depending on the Pokémon, that can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. Strong sunlight makes Fire-type moves stronger and Water-type moves weaker.
Yaaaay! Yaaay! Undella Town!!
Sometimes Jellicent float into Undella Bay. They have a reputation for being a little...unusual.
We're starting construction to further develop Undella's resorts. We just connected to the volcano, and we're in awe of nature's power!
Undella Town A Town of Rippling Waves
Reversal Mountain Ahead
Marine Tube Ahead The Walk-Through Aquarium
Zinzolin: Mmm, it's so warm here. Let me get to the point. I have papers that Lord Ghetsis left behind. With these, you can read the ancient scripts in the Abyssal Ruins. As my own small, little way to atone for my sins, I'll read them to you!
VAR(256, 0) is now able to read the Abyssal Ruins script!
Just to make sure you know, you reach the Abyssal Ruins by using Dive in Undella Bay. And you must write down the ciphers you find in the Abyssal Ruins by yourself.
According to Lord Ghetsis's papers, the ancient peoples read in the opposite direction to how we read now.
This is what was written in the papers... If you reach the second floor, read by shifting one letter. If you reach the third floor, read by shifting two letters. What I mean by “shifting" is replacing a letter with the previous letter in the alphabet.
The king must be the presence that stopped the war and united the people.
The king could see the future and talk to all living things. He united the people. If that is the truth, he was just like the hero!
There are some characters I can't recognize, but based on the context... An extremely wonderful king was laid to rest in those ruins. If that king has descendants, maybe those special powers were passed down...
What?! You made it even further, you say? And what kind of ciphers were there? ... ... Ahem... Oh, yes, now I see.
Keep searching! You need to write down the Abyssal Ruins ciphers.
Now that I've learned everything I wanted to know about the Abyssal Ruins, I take my leave. You are my enemy, but your accomplishments and skill make you a worthwhile enemy. Adieu!

The Marine Tube. It's an undersea tunnel, so to speak. Do you know how such tunnels are made? It's quite simple! They're built on land and then sunk into the sea! Without Pokémon, the construction would've been impossible.
I moved here just to be the first person to go through the Marine Tube.

???: What's this?
What's your name? ... OK. I'll remember that! VAR(256, 0), nice to meet you. I'm Cynthia. I'm a Pokémon Trainer, too, like you. I have an insatiable curiosity for researching Pokémon myths.
I'm sure you know about Undella Bay's Abyssal Ruins, right? I'm staying here at my friend's villa so I can investigate them.
In order to get to know each other better as Pokémon Trainers, I would like our Pokémon to have a match. Would you care to be my opponent?
Before I send out my Pokémon, my heart always begins to race... Interesting... My Pokémon in their Poké Balls are radiating a happy feeling. Are you the reason? What are you?
Ha ha. You prefer to take things slowly and rationally, am I right? When you're ready, come and talk to me. I'll be happy to see you.
Cynthia: Oh. You've had a chance to get ready? I do want our Pokémon to have a match... Are you prepared to be my opponent?
Cynthia: That was beyond my expectation! What an exceptional battle! I love being here in spring and summer. I can't stay all year, because there's so much to investigate in Sinnoh, as well. You're a great Trainer, and it would make me happy to see you again sometime.
Cynthia: I come here in spring and summer because there are a lot of things to investigate in Sinnoh, as well. I'd be delighted to see you again. You're an awesome Pokémon Trainer!
Cynthia: How terrific to see you again! I've got to tell you... My Pokémon are excited to battle yours. Would you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: This will be such fun! No holds barred!
Cynthia: Oh, what a pity. Summers in Undella Town make me feel like I'm on holiday. I forget about battling! But in spring, I feel like getting worked up with a good battle.
Cynthia: I can tell that my Pokémon are excited about battling your Pokémon... Would you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: For me, it has really been worthwhile to come all the way to far Unova. Why? Because... I met you, and my world got wider!
Cynthia: To live their lives to the fullest, people and Pokémon need the chance to throw themselves into battle against the fiercest opposition. That's why I want to battle you. How about it?
Cynthia: As our Pokémon meet in battle, I'll learn more about you and how you've taken care of them.
Cynthia: I'm a little disappointed. I know you can battle on bigger stages than you've done so far! It's so plain to me that your light can shine brighter than this...
Cynthia: Are you prepared? Let's battle at full strength and see how bright our lights can shine!
Cynthia: When you meet Trainers, battle them to learn about the kind of people they are. Observe the Pokémon they choose, which moves they taught them, and which items the Pokémon hold. You don't need words at such times... If you want to know more about me... Come to Sinnoh!
Caitlin: I used to own Battle Castles. Then I became one of Unova's Elite Four. Will I be a Champion somewhere next? You never know!
Caitlin: Darach is as neat as always. He came all the way to Unova, cleaned the villa, and then went home...
Caitlin: Tell me something. Are you familiar with Battle Castles? You can find them in Johto and Sinnoh, so challenge them to improve yourself.
Caitlin: This is my villa. I have villas all over the world, and I allow Cynthia to use them. You are welcome to come and play whenever you wish.
Caitlin: Having no psychic powers at all is better than having psychic powers you can't control.
Shauntal: When I'm writing novels, if I don't have enough input, my output suffers. It's the same thing for Trainers. To grow stronger, Trainers need to have countless battles and learn many things. Then, they must put what they've learned to the test in real battles.
Shauntal: Rainbow Wing... Silver Wing... They stir the imagination!
Shauntal: Distortion World... and the single Pokémon found there... What an amazing scene!
Shauntal: No matter how much research I do, I still have no clue. How old do you think Cynthia is? Any idea?
Shauntal: I chose my scarf with a certain Pokémon in mind. Do you get it? Using your imagination is important!
Cynthia: What is necessary for becoming stronger than you are now? My answer is simply loving Pokémon with all your heart. That's how I am, so that's all I can say.
Cynthia: The Champions of each region gather and compete to see who is the strongest! That is the Champions Tournament!
Cynthia: I'd love to live here... But if I did, there would be a mountain of research materials piled up... Am I right? Cynthia, enough for now! Next time, clean up.
Cynthia: Here's my problem. I have a white swimsuit and a black swimsuit... Which one would look better on me?
Cynthia: Hmm. This is difficult. I was greedy and brought a lot of swimsuits, but now I can't pick which one to wear.
Roxie: I want to be a strong Trainer and get even better on the bass. I'll make both come true, so life will be twice as sweet!
Roxie: You can use a pick or your fingers to play bass. Play the way you like! It's more fun that way!
Roxie: A bass guitar is heavier than a regular guitar! So it's more destructive--both in volume and as a weapon!
Roxie: Don't ever be satisfied!
Roxie: I... Am I living in you? Argh! It's so hard to think of lyrics! When I start singing, though, they just come naturally.
Skyla: I get along well with Elesa, but Pokémon battles are a different story! If you're not super prepared, your battles with Electric types will leave you in shock!
Skyla: Seeing the ground again after safely passing through a rain cloud in a violent rainstorm... Someday, I'd like to share that moment with you.
Skyla: I was just thinking about that. When it comes to swimsuits... You're either about self-composure or you're about self-exposure!
Skyla: Even distant Sinnoh is just a hop, skip, and a jump if I use a plane. But... I also love to travel the sky with a Pokémon when it's using Fly!
Skyla: Mmm... Swimming in the ocean sure feels great!
Elesa: I must say it's difficult for people to draw out a Pokémon's charm if they don't have any themselves.
Elesa: You know Nimbasa City? You know it runs on energy generated by Electric-type Pokémon? ...Just kidding!
Elesa: Getting wrapped up in worries is bad for your body and spirit. That's when you must short out your logic circuits and reboot your heart.
Elesa: Without a word... Without even a whisper... My Pokémon connect me to other Trainers, transmitting the current of my feelings.
Elesa: Put bluntly, swimsuits are nothing but cloth, right?
This villa belongs to Caitlin, one of the Pokémon League's Elite Four.

A beautiful tune is spreading throughout the town...
Oh, Pansage... Where could you be? We went to the amusement park and saw a musical. But when we were going home, Pansage got on a different train! I wonder where it is now...
Oh! Pokémon Trainer! You looked for my Pansage, didn't you? Thank you so much. This isn't much, but please take it.
Oh, my silly Pansage. A person with green hair told me that Pansage's dream is to become a railroad conductor! But... That guy... Can he talk with Pokémon?

Oh, are you also curious about that train?
Unfortunately, no train has come here today.
See the train there?
All righty! Let me explain!
All righty! All aboard!
Oh, that's a shame.
Hahaha! You're right.
Today's train car is a Hyperspeed Train! It runs faster than a rocket! It runs quieter than an air conditioner!
This is a Single Train! It's the oldest train in the Battle Subway.
This Super Single Train is a new mass-produced car!
This car is a Double Train! This is a mass-produced car from a decade ago!
This Super Double Train is a new mass-produced car!
This car is a Multi Train! Few cars of this model were produced.
This train car is a Super Multi Train! This is the latest train car!
This train car is a Wi-Fi Train! It is the fastest long-distance high-speed train in the Battle Subway!
As you know, this is a local train to Anville Town! Isn't it just so cute?
This train car is the kind that ran a long time ago.
This train car is a new train to run in the future!
I can see! I can see it! That lovely smooth curve! Ah, I wish I could reach out and touch it!
It's for a loop line to go around the Unova region!
It's an environmentally friendly train, because they revised all the parts to drastically reduce power consumption!
Compared to a Single Train, the number of parts was reduced so it could be built for a lower cost.
Such a streamlined and refined design! Beauty and utility working together! That kind of beautility is unique to mass-produced train cars!
This is a test car to develop future mass-produced cars that will replace the old Double Trains.
Improved acceleration and deceleration! Automated train-car controls! It's full of cutting-edge technologies.
This is called a pendulum car. Its body tilts while going around curves, so it can run without slowing down!
This one is a little slow and heavy. When it runs, the whole train sways.
Compared to contemporary train cars, it has more parts, so I heard it was difficult to build.
Wooo! Cool! Super cool! The latest motor breathes fire!
I can see it so clearly! But I cannot touch the Hyperspeed Train! It really is hyper technology! As you can see, we engineers are always seriously dreaming that someday the dream will become a reality!
Do you know Tubeline Bridge? The train that runs on it is this Single Train.
Newer trains have to be built in a way that's both functional and environmentally friendly. Compared to the past, they've improved significantly.
The number of parts influences the budget and construction time. The streamlined and beautiful design of the Double Train is still valued today.
It uses the same train car as a Super Single Train. The only difference is the appearance. It is a superb train car that will go down in the history of the Battle Subway!
The technology born during the creation of this train car made the Super Single Train and Super Double Train possible!
Also, a regeneration brake system, a car-body tilting system, a whatchamacallit system, a thingamabob system... I don't remember all the details, but it's just a big festival of all the latest technology!
Faster! Farther! Our engineers' spirits are infused in it!
The train car is the same model as a Single Train. Because it is an old train car, I hear the maintenance is hard, but it's the one I always ride, because I loved it as a kid!
The old train cars built with lots of small parts have their own unique beauty and attract a lot of fans. Those cars no longer run in the Battle Subway, but I hear they're still used in a faraway region. Ah... I'd love to be on that train!
Uh-oh, if it really breathed fire, that would be bad! But it is full of the latest technologies! It's undergoing a lot of testing. It's called a gauge-convertible train. It's a sweet car that can adjust its wheels to run on any rail!
A train to Nimbasa City is leaving the station shortly. Would you like to board?
Then, please get on the train and wait.
This is a quiet town! Relax and stay for a while.

You can trade lots of items. It was surprisingly fun when I tried!

The device that changes the direction of trains is called a turntable!
Trains are so cooooool! My mom brought me, but now she's taking pictures somewhere.
On weekends, a lot of people come here to watch the trains.
They are full of people today, too. Do you also trade items?
This is a rare weekend when there aren't any trains.
A lot of train cars have a rest here.
If there are a lot of people, I feel that the trains are happy!
Today all the train cars are resting!
The girl on the bridge... She's playing a lullaby for all the sleeping trains of this town.

Oh ho! With a face like that, I'll bet you're a Pokémon Trainer! I work as a Depot Agent on the Battle Subway! Have you tried challenging the Battle Subway yet? It's a hot spot for those who want some serious battling action! But some people get too wrapped up in their battles, and there's no end to the lost-and-found items. That's right. Nobody ever came to pick this up, so I'll give it to you!
I have a lost-and-found item that no one has claimed. If you don't mind, could you take it off my hands?
Oh! I've been waiting for you! Recently, we've gotten more passengers, so there's more lost-and-found items! No one has claimed this, so if you don't mind, could you take it off my hands?
No worries. No worries. Just take it! It's better for a Trainer to use it than for me to hold on to it. I'm sure the item is happier, too!
If I have another lost-and-found item, come get it, OK? Also, if you're interested, take on the Battle Subway in Nimbasa City!
Oh, my. There's no more room for the VAR(265, 0). You'll need to remove some from your Bag before you can accept any more!

Alder: Oh, that's right! VAR(256, 0), are your Pokémon well? Your Pokémon are always doing their best for you, the Trainer, so you must always be kind to them!
My house is just a little farther! Stop by the Pokémon Center first if you'd like!
Alder: Hey, this way! Shall we start training?
By the way...why are you holding two Town Maps? ...
Oh ho! It's your friend's Town Map, is it?
Your friend is the one with the VAR(257, 0), isn't he? It just so happens, he was training his Pokémon on Route 20... Well, if that's the case, you should go give him the Town Map first!
Just follow this road. It goes to Route 20!
Just follow this road. It goes right to Route 20! I'll be waiting here until you deliver the Town Map!
Alder: Oh! It looks like you've delivered the Town Map to your friend! Hrm... You were only gone a moment, but you and your Pokémon have grown. Why, I could almost mistake you for someone else! Well then. Instead of training you, I would like you and your Pokémon to give me a hand!
Alder: VAR(256, 0)! You know the Trainers' School and Pokémon Gym that were just built in Aspertia? I received notice that the Gym Leader has arrived! So I have some advice for you. If you want to see how much you understand your partners, your Pokémon, then you should challenge the Gym Leader!
In the morning, my Pokémon come to wake me up when they're hungry. At night, my Pokémon get tired from playing and take up the whole bed! Oh! It fills me with so much joy!
You see, in Floccesy Ranch, wild Pokémon might surprise you! At times like that, only your own Pokémon can help you out!
I always save a record of my adventure, so I don't forget what I've done so far! It's a good idea for any Trainer!
People always think the past or the future would be so wonderful. But the great time we're spending with Pokémon is right now!
Want to know what Alder taught me?
He said the Pokémon you throw out at the start of battle is the one in the upper-left slot in your party! That's why I put a Pokémon I want to make stronger or a Pokémon that's already tough in that spot!
You're being too bashful! It's a good opportunity! Ask away!
Are you happy you're able to train Pokémon?
Right?! Me too!
Huh? But you're traveling with Pokémon!
Floccesy Town Prophecy Flocks Here
It's an old clock tower...
Bianca: Heeey!
Bianca: Hey there!
I'm sorry! I forgot to upgrade the Pokédex that I gave you! I'm going to add the Habitat List! It's an amazing feature! I'm just going to borrow your Pokédex for a second!
VAR(256, 0)'s Pokédex was upgraded!
With the Habitat List, you can check which Pokémon are in the area! It's a mode in the Pokédex!
To use it, open up the Pokédex and tap the Habitat List button on the lower left of the Touch Screen! Next, pick the area you want to see! You can see all the Pokémon that live in that area. It even tells you which ones you've already caught! Would you like to hear my explanation again?
I have a tip for you! When you're walking down a path, you'll sometimes see rustling grass! If you go to that spot... Well, I'll let the rest be a surprise!
Filling up the Pokédex will make your world bigger! So go to many different places and meet many different Pokémon, OK? See you!

Your VAR(257, 0) is male! I wonder what the difference is between male and female Pokémon.
Your VAR(257, 0) is female! I wonder what the difference is between male and female Pokémon.
Your VAR(257, 0)... Its gender is unknown. I wonder what the difference is between male and female Pokémon.

Girl: Oh! Are we going to help train that person, sir?
Boy: Really? But that Trainer looks really tough!
Alder: That's right! This Trainer may be tough, but you can learn from losing as well. More importantly, haven't I been telling you just to enjoy Pokémon battles?
So, VAR(256, 0)! Please be their opponent!
I'll show you what's cool about my Pokémon!
That was a fine battle, both of you. Well, next we have...
Ready!
Alder: First we have to heal your Pokémon, VAR(256, 0).
Girl: Some Pokémon battles are decided by type matchups!
Alder: That was truly a rousing battle! I could tell that all of the Pokémon were enjoying themselves as well!
How about it, VAR(256, 0)? Pokémon types are very important in battle, aren't they? Water is strong against Fire... Fire is strong against Grass... Grass is strong against Water... Type matchups don't decide everything, though!
But, listen! When a Pokémon uses a move that matches its type, the move becomes more powerful!
Let's heal those hard-working Pokémon! VAR(257, 1)! You did a great job for VAR(256, 0)!
Meeting Pokémon and people you never would have met otherwise is truly one of the great things about traveling!
Alder: Oh! You won a Gym Badge! That's the result of understanding your Pokémon and bringing out their power!
Alder: Getting that many Gym Badges is impressive! But you're only partway through your journey... What does being strong really mean?
Alder: Oh! You've come! Could I spar with you, the strongest Trainer in the Unova region?
Alder: Oh! You've come! I want to show them what's incredible about Trainers as well! Could I spar with you, the strongest Trainer in the Unova region?
Oh! My heart jumps for joy! Well, then, prepare yourself for battle! Kiai!
Hrm... Well, I shall wait here, then.
Alder: That's the Champion for you!
???: Gramps! I did it! I did it! I DID it! The Black Tower! I made it to the top!
???: Gramps! I did it! I did it! I DID it! The White Treehollow! I made it to the deepest part!
Alder: Why, if it isn't Benga! Are you serious, boy?
Benga: Hey! Gramps! You know how strong I am! Hey, hey!
Who's that?
Alder: His name is VAR(256, 0)! He's the strongest Trainer in the Unova region.
Alder: Her name is VAR(256, 0)! She's the strongest Trainer in the Unova region.
Benga: I knew it! That Trainer smells tough!
Alder: How about it, Benga? Do you want to spar, perhaps?
Benga: No! I know that Trainer's strong! And I want to battle! But those Pokémon haven't been through enough!
Me! And my Pokémon! We climbed to the top of the Black Tower! You do that, too! There we'll see who's stronger! Let's try hard to be the best!
Me! And my Pokémon! We made it to the deepest part of the White Treehollow! You do that, too! There we'll see who's stronger! Let's try hard to be the best!
Later! Gramps and VAR(256, 0)!
Alder: He's a lively one, even for MY grandson! I'll explain what he was talking about. He challenged a place called the Black Tower, which appeared in Black City. You'll find out what kind of place it is if you go there. An ordinary Trainer, however, can't make it to where he is. So that's the story! If you'd like, you should take the challenge as well.

Alder: When you find something you want to do, you should take it on without a moment of doubt! Don't worry! You have Pokémon by your side, right? If you're together, you can do things you can't do alone, and your Pokémon can go places they couldn't go on their own.
My dream is to strengthen my Pokémon here and become the strongest Trainer in Unova!
I think I can get even stronger if I learn more about Pokémon! That's why I want to go to many different places--so I can learn a lot!
Hey! Hey! Hey! It was a promise! Between me and you! We had the best match! This is to remember it by! Raise this Gible!

As they wandered in search of Pokémon, people began making homes in more places. This ranch used to be a grassy meadow. It's now become a place where people and Pokémon have homes together!
I don't really know much about Pokémon types and stuff like that. I just focus on raising one Pokémon and charge ahead! But it's kinda the hard way to do things. When I run into a Pokémon that mine is not good against, I can't win anymore!
Oh, you have so many Pokémon! Seems to me that thinking about how to raise each one would be a lot of fun!
Yip!

Professor Juniper: Well, I suppose I should tell you why I brought you out here.
Cheren told me that a group of people calling themselves Team Plasma are planning to use legendary Pokémon to take over the Unova region.
As you may know, in the Unova region, there are two legendary Dragon-type Pokémon: Zekrom and Reshiram...
As you may know, in the Unova region, there are two legendary Dragon-type Pokémon: Reshiram and Zekrom...
But two years ago, Zekrom and Reshiram each recognized a Trainer as a hero. They are following those Trainers. So Team Plasma shouldn't be able to use the Dragon-type Pokémon...
But two years ago, Reshiram and Zekrom each recognized a Trainer as a hero. They are following those Trainers. So Team Plasma shouldn't be able to use the Dragon-type Pokémon...
Bianca: That's true... What could they be planning?
Professor Juniper: There is much we don't know about Zekrom and Reshiram... That's why I want to hear what Opelucid City's Gym Leader, Drayden, has to say about this. He's a Dragon-type Gym Leader, so he might know something. So, we're finally to the reason why I brought you here. I want you to go to Opelucid City and hear what Drayden has to say. And, I would also like you to help me if something happens!

Thank you! It's really best not to get involved with Team Plasma to start with. But still...
Yes. That is the more reasonable response. It's best not to get involved with Team Plasma. But...
Hearing what Drayden has to say about the Dragon-type Pokémon will be really interesting. And more importantly, it will help fill up the pages of your Pokédex!
Bianca: I'll be in the volcano just beyond here... I'm going to investigate the rumors I've been hearing about a rare Fire-type Pokémon in Reversal Mountain.
Drayden is a Gym Leader, so unless you defeat him in a Pokémon battle, he probably won't talk to you.
If the season changes, the scenery from the plane changes. If the climate changes, the local architecture changes!
Why am I on a journey? Do you remember exactly why you're traveling?
I'm fine even right by a volcano thanks to my li'l Krokorok! It really rocks!
Rah feh feh!
Deliver a lot of cargo quickly! This is Lentimas Cargo Service. Would you like to board the plane and fly back to Mistralton City?
OK! Please board the plane and wait!
OK! Feel free to ride anytime!

A cool mind feels no heat!
He he he. You're a Trainer, aren't you? Don't say anything. Just take this.
Let a Pokémon hold a Spell Tag. It powers up Ghost-type moves. Oh! You have a Spell Tag! Where in the world did you find it?
Hmm? Are you going to check the volcano, too? The volcano here is the same kind of volcano as Stark Mountain in the Sinnoh region.

Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Magic Coat! Magic Coat can reflect any opponent's move that lowers stats or inflicts status conditions during the turn the move is used. But, there are moves that Magic Coat can't reflect, so be careful!
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Block! Block prevents the target from escaping or switching out. But, depending on the opponent's move, held item, or Ability, it can switch out or escape. So, don't let your guard down.
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Gravity! Gravity intensifies gravity for five turns, from the turn the move is used! When gravity is intensified, Ground-type moves can hit Flying-type Pokémon and Pokémon with the Levitate Ability. On top of that, the accuracy of most moves will be boosted. It also has the effect of making Fly and Jump Kick unusable.
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Magnet Rise! Magnet Rise levitates the user for five turns from the turn it's used. After using Magnet Rise, the Pokémon won't be hit by Ground-type moves! Electric- and Steel-type Pokémon are weak against Ground-type moves. Have them use the move, and they can cover their weakness.
Hey, Trainer! The move I recommend for you is none other than Last Resort! Last Resort is seemingly a very powerful move, but it will fail if the Pokémon who learned the move hasn't used all of its other moves. When to use it is difficult to tell, but it's a very powerful move!
This quiz is difficult. “What will happen when you press SELECT while you are checking the Town Map?" I don't know, because I don't have one!

So, I guess it's interesting for me because I have a lot to think about. Nancy: Wow! That's so deep! Cheren, I've heard that you traveled all over the Unova region. I hope you're able to share what you learned from your experiences. OK! This was Nancy reporting! ...

I mean, c'mon, there's no winning and losing in singing! I'm happy if there are people or Pokémon who hear our songs and think they're good! Nancy: But, Roxie!

OK! Hello, everyone! Nancy here! Today, we're visiting Opelucid City's Gym Leader, Drayden! So, let's start with the big question! Why do you spar with your Pokémon? Drayden: Mh hm... It's good to remember that people and Pokémon are both living beings, rather than just the one who gives commands and the one who follows them. It's good for a Pokémon and its Trainer to test their desire to win against each other. Nancy: Ah ha ha! I don't quite get it, but you're very passionate about it! Okaaay! This was Nancy reporting! ...
OK! Hello, everyone! Nancy here! Today, we're visiting Humilau City's Gym Leader, Marlon! Marlon, you're famous for your amazing jumping ability! How can you jump like that? Marlon: Yo!

I thought that someday I'd like to jump higher than those Mantine. That's it. Nancy: That's amazing!

Best of Sinnoh TV I was just your average girl until I was literally stricken by a ThunderShock. It was love at first sight, baby! And my target, a Gym Leader! I didn't have any Pokémon then, but not a problem for a resourceful gal! The answer was simple! And we all know simple is best! I just had to become a Trainer. That's all it took for me! “The Diary of a Poké Romantic" will soon make its debut! The pilot episode: “Love at First Sight! The Rules of the Move Attract!" By the way, how did everyone get their first Pokémon anyway? ...
Best of Sinnoh TV After some fits and starts, a childhood friend gave me my first Pokémon! ...But it was a Kricketot. When I don't like the legs of bugs... I bet he gave me this because I picked on him when he was little... But though the road has been long and hard, I'm finally at the starting line! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode 2! “The Maiden in Love and the Kricketot. The Magic of Romance Never Ends!" Oh, this Kricketot is a female. Maybe we can be friends. ...
Best of Sinnoh TV I checked out my Kricketot and learned about its moves. ...It only knows Growl and Bide. That's worse than just challenging! I was about to say that, when my childhood friend stopped me. “Let it hold an Oran Berry so that it can survive while using Bide." Hey, that's smart! That's from a former Bug Catcher! While we're at it, can I have an Oran Berry, too? Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode 3! “Love Conquers All. Covering Weakness with Ideas!" We're a Trainer and Pokémon now! We'll get stronger together! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV I had my first ever Pokémon battle, and it ended badly... My childhood friend, a former Bug Catcher, had this to say. “Pokémon get tougher by battling. The key to victory is type matchups." Type matchups? Types affect battles? The only type matchup I care about is with that Gym Leader! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode 4! “Type Matchups Settle Battles! Moves That Exploit Weak Points!" Fire, Flying, and Rock... Kricketot has some disadvantages! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV We'd win a battle, and lose one. Lose one, then win one. Though it was discouraging, I had to keep battling to toughen us up. With me and Kricketot, it was always three steps forward, two steps back. But we were getting stronger. Then one day, Kricketot started to shine! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode 5! “Kricketot Becomes Kricketune! Watch Me! I'll Change, Too!" And, to cancel evolution, press the B Button... Tell me that first! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV After Kricketot evolved, it became stronger as Kricketune. We also got other Pokémon, so we could go farther and farther from home. But where is my beloved Gym Leader? Where is that city he said he's from? I do have the Town Map, but maps baffle me. It doesn't matter, though. If we keep moving, we'll get somewhere. Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode 6! “How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms Can't Be Found Everywhere!" The more lost you are, the less useful a map becomes! You know it's true! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV Our journey was long, and it was hard. But no one wants to hear that! So, I finally found my Gym Leader. But, he has an incurable disease! He begged me, out of the blue, with his last wish. He asked for my Pokémon! But my Kricketune's my partner! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode 7! “My Trail of Footprints Shortened the Distance Between Us!" Every time I see Kricketune's face, I get reminded of our time together... ...
Best of Sinnoh TV My beloved Gym Leader, whom I fought so hard to meet, was a fraud! How dare he con this pure maiden! How dare he toy with my emotions! But whose fault was it? Was it mine for being taken in? All I know is that my tears overflow, and despair is my world... Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," episode 8! “Kricketune and I! Our Bond Is True!" That Gym Leader's eating a Giga Impact for playing me for a fool! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV Having defeated the fake Gym Leader, Kricketune and I stood in a daze. We were spent. Drained by a romance that ended as a nightmare. It was then my childhood friend, the former Bug Catcher, arrived. He did more than that. He confessed his love to me! “I wanted to become an Elite Four member, so I quit as a Gym Leader. But, then, that faker appeared. You took care of him, though!" Wait, ex-Bug Catcher! What? What are you saying?! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic," final episode! “Do it, Kricketune! Silver Wind over Sinnoh Skies!" You were laughing at me for falling for that fraud, weren't you? ...

VAR(256, 1): You found them! I knew you could do it!
But... How do we get in?
???: Hold up!
A heavy gangplank fell with a solid thud...
Marlon: Eh, this should do it!
VAR(256, 1): I thought you weren't going to fight Team Plasma?
Marlon: Hey, friends! Team Plasma's not botherin' me. They could be up to no good for reals, and... It's not my style to go around decidin' Team Plasma's bad without thinkin' 'bout it just 'cause everyone says so!
But, eh, you're havin' trouble, so I've got to help out! That's what I want to do!
VAR(256, 1): Thanks...
Marlon: Listen, 'K. Believe in somethin'! Searchin' for stolen Pokémon is fine! Keepin' Unova from bein' iced over's fine too! It's all good. But think 'bout why you're doin' that. The strength of your beliefs is what gives you and your Pokémon power!
I made some noise, so some people came out!
Hey, be careful, 'K!
VAR(256, 1): What was that?! The guy sure doesn't follow through!
Well, I guess he was being kind in his own way... All right, I'm going in!
VAR(256, 1): Team Plasma! No matter where you fly, I won't let you get away! But, what's over there anyway?
Cheren: Sorry I'm late... I suspect that they're flying toward the Giant Chasm.
VAR(256, 1): The Giant Chasm! That's deep in Route 22, right? OK, I'm going! VAR(256, 0)! You come too!
That Pokémon... Kyurem, was it? Its cry sounded lonely somehow.
Cheren: Kyurem! Team Plasma is using Kyurem's power for evil?!
Then how should we stop Team Plasma? If Kyurem is, like Drayden said, a legendary Dragon-type Pokémon, the only ones who could stand up to it are Reshiram or Zekrom! But... Neither of them is here right now... Where are the ones the legendary Pokémon recognized as heroes, anyway? I guess I just have to find one of them!

===============================
Cheren: I learned something from this battle... But only a little. What does it mean to be strong...? What are Pokémon...? There are so many things I don't know!
Roxie: Congrats on taking first! Losing stinks, but still... You're a fun Pokémon Trainer to battle! I mean, c'mon! The Pokémon battling with you are all like, “We're gonna win!"
Burgh: Ummm... That's right. Bug-type Pokémon are cool, aren't they? Win or lose, they're always beautiful.
Elesa: My Pokémon work hard for me, so I want to do what I can for them. And I want them to bathe in the glamorous spotlight as well. In that sense, your Pokémon were gleaming very brightly!
Clay: Am I all right with a Trainer like ya winning the Tournament, ya say? Ya think there're stronger Trainers out there yet? Talented Trainers who think like that are just who I want to come here to Driftveil City!
Skyla: I'm in top form, and I can see what my opponent is trying to do. And I still couldn't win! That's because Pokémon battling is really deep, and you're really great!
Drayden: I may be old, but I desire victory! This desire is the energy for life! It's the power to surpass who I was the previous day! I complement you on your victory, but next time, victory will be mine!
Marlon: Eh, right now, you're like a ragin' sea that washes everythin' away! Uihaa! What a great battle, yo!
Bianca: Even if it's just little by little, I'm learning about Pokémon. I'm thinking about how to bring out the best from everyone, but I still have a ways to go. Oh, I almost forgot! Congratulations on your victory!
Chili: You scorched everyone, huh? That's amazing! I want to win too and become Chili, the world's best Trainer of Fire-type Pokémon!
Cress: The pairings for the tournament partly contributed to your victory. Please keep training. I plan on retraining myself with the aim of defeating you after you've become even stronger.
Cilan: Well...I'm just glad I was able to bring out the delectable charm of Grass-type Pokémon. I lost, though... Well, more importantly, congratulations!
Lenora: Battling is second nature to you, isn't it? It's always best to be natural, no matter when it is and what kind of situation you're in. Your victory is the result of that, right?
Brycen: A tournament is a story, too... And the stars of this story were you and your Pokémon.
Blue: Three wins and you've done it! Luck can also be a factor, and I'm still not satisfied at all! Oh, I didn't think you won because of luck, though!
Lance: I'm sure you already know, but dragons are sacred and legendary creatures! That's why I won't lose next time!
Steven: Hmm. Emerald can be mined in Driftveil City?!
Wallace: The reason for my defeat... It's... The grand illusion of water! It wasn't enough!
Cynthia: I sincerely applaud your victory in the tournament. However, there must be many other strong opponents in the world... I want to keep meeting many different people and Pokémon in different places.
Alder: Well done! That was an impressive battle. The spirit of my first partner, Larvesta--no, Volcarona--lives on in my current partners, too! I want to add your strength to their experience as well!
Brock: Awesome... That was a really great battle. I compliment you on your victory!
Misty: My pride and joy are my Water-type Pokémon. But they were no match for yours. Thank you for teaching me the world is a really big place.
Lt. Surge: You are very strong! You're the victor! I'm not gonna lose! I'll train hard and be number one in Pokémon battling!
Erika: Oh! I admire your technique. It would make me very happy if I could battle with you again.
Sabrina: Your victory... It's exactly as I foresaw actually. But I wanted to turn that future on its head with my conviction as a Trainer!
Blaine: Whoa hey! This time I'm sure of the victor's strength! Next time, I'll be even more of a raging inferno!
Giovanni: I'll tell you this now... No matter how strong you are, someday you'll lose.
Falkner: As long as I have lofty ambitions, I can fly as far as I want. I'll keep flying and aiming high! Just like you!
Bugsy: I never lose when it comes to Bug-type Pokémon. I'm so embarrassed to have said that. I'll start my studies of other Pokémon over from the beginning, too. I'm truly grateful that you made me realize I need to do that.
Whitney: I was surprised by how strong you were! I can see why you won the tournament. When you have a chance, tell me all about why you're so strong!
Morty: I'm desperate to know the secret of your strength. If I unlock the secret, my dream to see the legendary Pokémon may come true! Excuse me. I got ahead of myself. Congratulations on your victory.
Chuck: Hmmm! I enjoyed battling you. The Trainer who wins the tournament has got something special!
Jasmine: The blend of your kindness and your Pokémon's strength brought this victory to you. Um... Keep on doing your best... with your Pokémon.
Pryce: If it's someone like you, I'm sure you'll keep winning and will find something important. Keep it up.
Clair: What?! Come to brag about your victory? Fine. I'll say it to you. Congratulations! You were really tough! There! Are you happy now?
Janine: While I admire your victory, I'm disappointed that I lost... I'm still not a full-fledged Trainer yet. I'll train with my father to be better than before and challenge you again!
Roxanne: You were flawless. You're a role model for Trainers. The way you battle makes it hard to put it any other way. I can understand why you won! I want to learn even more about you!
Brawly: Your skill is top notch... You made a big splash! Do you want to Surf with me?
Wattson: Wahahahah! That was a great victory! I'm so impressed by the way you battle that I can't help but laugh!
Flannery: Your strength is the way you're able to express yourself. Everybody was very excited by your victory!
Norman: You went all out and earned that victory... You're a wonderful Trainer! I want my kid to learn from you.
Winona: Your devotion... That's what brought you victory. It's praiseworthy.
Tate: The fact that you won means your combination with your Pokémon must've been super perfect!
Liza: The fact that you won means your combination with your Pokémon must've been super perfect!
Juan: I see! Your elegance radiates glitz and glamor. It's only natural that you won the tournament.
Roark: With skill like yours, it's natural for you to win. Still, wasn't it hard to train Pokémon that much? By the way, are there any Fossils in Nacrene City's museum?
Gardenia: Amazing! Hey! How do you feel? I want to win and brag about my Pokémon, too!
Fantina: I'm so very happy! Because you're so very strong! There's so much I can learn from you. I can become even stronger. When I do, let's battle again!
Maylene: Looking at the way you battle, I learned something! You like your Pokémon! I think it's wonderful!
Crasher Wake: I may have lost, but battling with you was fun! I hope your victory will put more smiles on people's faces!
Byron: Guhahahaha! I lost, but I saw something great. Well, guess I'll go back to Sinnoh and start my son's training over! All right! Next time I take part in the tournament, I'll play to win!
Candice: You won because your focus was far greater than the others! Yes! I have to focus even more as well!
Volkner: I like how your Pokémon respond to your earnest enthusiasm. I'm glad someone who knows how to enjoy Pokémon battles won the tournament.
Red: ...!

Cheren is a new Gym Leader in Aspertia City. Nonetheless, for his age, he's very experienced and brilliant.
Roxie! Roxie is performing brilliantly in her band while being a Gym Leader in Virbank City. She is a vocalist and bass guitarist!
Burgh is an artist and also the Gym Leader of Castelia City. I heard he polished his skills in Nacrene City.
Elesa! She's the Gym Leader of Nimbasa City and also a top model. No, she's the top model among top models! The best top model! Er... Everybody in the Unova region knows it, right?
Clay... He doesn't look it, but he's a hardworking man. You'll know much more about him if you go to the Pokémon Gym in Driftveil City.
Skyla! As a pilot, she exceeded her grandfather who was called a gifted pilot. On top of that, she's the Gym Leader of Mistralton City! She's great! She's a good friend of Elesa.
Drayden is the mayor and the Gym Leader of Opelucid City. He recognized Iris's talent and brought her to the Unova region.
Marlon is the Gym Leader of Humilau City! Putting that aside, being a man of the sea is not a profession, is it?
Bianca! She's an assistant of Professor Juniper! She's from Nuvema Town and started her journey of adventure with Cheren and another friend! She's humble, but she's a pretty strong Trainer.
Chili! He's a triplet in Striaton City! I believe he uses Fire-type Pokémon.
Cress! He's a triplet in Striaton City! I believe he uses Water-type Pokémon.
Cilan! He's a triplet in Striaton City! I believe he uses Grass-type Pokémon.
Lenora! She's the director of Nacrene Museum. I guess she was too busy with her research and quit being the Gym Leader. Retaliate that her Watchog used was impressive!
Brycen! He's now an outstanding movie star in Pokéstar Studios. Having said that, he was originally an actor.
Blue is a grandson of Professor Oak. Anything else? Oh, I believe he's a former Champion and the Gym Leader of Viridian City.
Lance. He's the Champion of the Pokémon League in the Kanto region. I think that he uses Dragon-type Pokémon and that he's from Blackthorn City.
Steven is a son of a wealthy family and a former Champion of Hoenn. It might ring a bell if I say his hobby is to collect Stones!
Wallace is the Champion of Hoenn. He was originally a Gym Leader. I wonder why he replaced Steven.
Cynthia!! She's the Champion of the Sinnoh region and an archeologist! She balances the use of various types of Pokémon! Rumor has it that she comes to a villa in Undella Town for her research!
Alder! He's the previous Champion of the Unova region. He's gone through a lot of hardship, but he's a person of high caliber.
Brock! He's the Gym Leader of Pewter City. He uses Rock-type Pokémon. I heard he's proud of his strong defense.
Misty! Misty is the Gym Leader of Cerulean City. As she's called the Tomboyish Mermaid, she's an active, beautiful girl!
Lt. Surge! He used to be a soldier and acts as the Gym Leader of Vermilion City. Is he from the Unova region?
Lady Erika! She's a lady who is the Gym Leader of Celadon City! Is her hobby flower arrangement? She dozes off quite often, but her laid-back personality is part of her charm.
Queen Sabrina! She's a psychic and the Gym Leader that Saffron City is proud of! Aww, calling her “queen" fits her image for me. Ah! I want her to see my future by Future Sight!
Blaine! The Hotheaded Quiz Master. He's the Gym Leader of Cinnabar Island, but he had a tough time. The original Gym was destroyed and he had to go to Seafoam Islands.
Giovanni... I heard a lot of rumors about him, but I don't know much about him.
Falkner! He's the Gym Leader of Violet City. He's a young man who battles with Pokémon that his father counted on.
Bugsy. He's a Gym Leader who's called “The Walking Bug Pokémon Encyclopedia." Oh! The town he's in is Azalea! ...I think.
Whitney! She's the Gym Leader of Goldenrod City! I believe she loves softball and wears clothes that look like a uniform. The first thing I think about her is Rollout!
Morty! He's a stoic Gym Leader. He's training to see the legendary Pokémon in Ecruteak City.
Chuck. His wife thinks he's getting chubby. He's the Gym Leader of Cianwood City!
Jasmine! She's a compassionate woman of Steel! She's the Gym Leader of Olivine City. She participates in Contests in the Sinnoh region. I heard she used to use Rock-type Pokémon!
Pryce. He's the Gym Leader of Mahogany Town. He's a cool gentleman!
Clair! She uses Dragon-type Pokémon, and she's the Gym Leader of Blackthorn City! I heard Lance is her senior when it comes to training, and she's no match for him! I hope Clair will be stronger than Lance very soon!
Janine! Again. Janine! She's the Gym Leader of Fuchsia City, and her father is Koga! He's one of the Elite Four!
Roxanne! She's a teacher of a Trainers' School and also the Gym Leader of Rustboro City! It's hard to tell how old she is-- or any other women.
Brawly. He's the Gym Leader of Dewford Town. Is he a Gym Leader or a surfer?
Wattson. He's the Gym Leader of Mauville City. Being cheerful all the time is the secret to his health.
Flannery! She's the Gym Leader of Lavaridge Town. I heard she loves hot springs! And, I also heard her grandfather used to be one of the Elite Four!
Norman. He's the Gym Leader of Petalburg City. He is a friend of Professor Birch, who is famous in the Hoenn region.
Winona! She's the Gym Leader of Fortree City. She spreads her wings around the world. She's a perfect Trainer for this tournament!
Tate is one of the Gym Leaders of Mossdeep City. He'll challenge you for Double Battle with his twin, Liza.
Liza! She and her twin, Tate, are the Gym Leaders of Mossdeep City. As you expect of twins, they're good at Double Battles!
Juan! He's Wallace's teacher and the Gym Leader of Sootopolis City. I guess he's a ladies man.
Roark. He's the young Gym Leader of Oreburgh City. He supervises people who work in the mines in the city.
Gardenia! I heard she's afraid of ghosts! She's the respectable Gym Leader of Eterna City, though! Having said that, everybody has something they don't like, right?
Fantina! She tends to be misunderstood due to her flashy appearance, but she's a Gym Leader with a compassionate heart! She consoles Pokémon's spirits at the Lost Tower near Hearthome City.
Maylene! The barefoot fighting genius! She's the Gym Leader of Veilstone City and very serious about learning what it is to be strong!
Crasher Wake! He's a professional wrestler and a Gym Leader. He's an admirable man who uses his prize money for Pastoria City.
Byron! He's the Gym Leader of Canalave City. He always carries a shovel. By the way, he's the father of Roark, who's the Gym Leader of Oreburgh City.
Candice! She's the spirited Gym Leader of Snowpoint City! She also guards the temple in the city!
Volkner... He's the Leader of Sunyshore City. I heard he renovated the Pokémon Gym and caused blackouts in the city.
Red...? I don't know much about him, but I heard he is a legendary Trainer.
       
I know much about strong Trainers! So, I'll tell you about Gym Leaders and Champions and so on once you've battled them!

Silvia: Ommm... Oh! I'm sorry! I was sunbathing, and my mind went blank, like I was meditating... Ommm... Isn't the weather great? Would you like to “om" with me?
Silvia: W-wow! Did you see that? That lazybones store owner put new items in the shop! He's had the same old stuff on display forever! Hmmm... It's fine as long as it doesn't rain, I guess.
Silvia: While I was just standing around and watching Pokémon play, I started to feel so happy and peaceful! I hope tomorrow is a pleasant day just like today!
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Robbie: My big brother is working in the shop, but he thinks putting new goods out is too much trouble. So go explore a hollow or something, and check back later.
Robbie: Amazing! My brother finally put some new items in the shop he's working at. He's the type who can do anything if he wants to!
Robbie: My brother is just raring to go lately! He keeps putting all sorts of new products in the store! He said he was inspired by a Trainer named VAR(256, 0) who became the best Trainer in the White Treehollow!
       
       
       
       
       
Ryder: Recently in Unova's Challenge-- the White Treehollow-- talented Trainers are falling one after another. Apparently, a Trainer named VAR(256, 0) is on a rampage. That's not you, is it? I want to have a match with that Trainer sometime.
Ryder: You're VAR(256, 0)?! You're the best in the White Treehollow! That's incredible. I'm still having problems with the first area... Give me some tips later, all right?
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Carlos: In White Forest, everyone shares the gathered Berries. I picked some extra ones for the older folks.
Carlos: Living here every day, eating Berries, makes me miss the exciting and exotic food you can get in the city sometimes. Maybe it's time again to go on a quest for delicious food. It's been a while.
Carlos: When I went to the shop to prepare for my trip, I noticed the selection of items has gotten much better. But the guy in the shop was saying he can't lose to VAR(256, 0). What could he have been talking about?
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Gene: A hollow has suddenly appeared in the white tree! That tree is really important to us here in White Forest! Investigators and Trainers have come out of the woodwork, but we locals will be the ones who make it to the lowest floor!
Gene: Hey, VAR(256, 0)! I heard the news! You made it really deep into the hollow, didn't you? Hurry and get to the lowest level for me--I'm about to give up!
Gene: On behalf of everyone in the forest, I want to congratulate you on becoming the top Trainer of the White Treehollow! Congratulations! That was a major accomplishment!
       
       
       
       
       
Miho: Waah! I'm so bored! I just got here, but I can't handle living like this where there's nothing to do! I miss the neon so much!
Miho: Since I've moved here, my skin has become so smooth! I wonder if it's because I'm eating fresh-picked Berries every day. Nature is so amazing! Hooray for nature!
Miho: Lying on my back in a meadow and idly watching the sun sink behind the trees... It's these simple, ordinary things that are the most fun in this place! The people here taught me that!
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Rosaline: Oh no! This is no good at all... Every day, I just nap away, and now I'm really rusty! OK! OK! I'm going to get back into fighting shape by training in the White Treehollow!
Rosaline: I'm also taking on the White Treehollow! There are nothing but strange Trainers inside! But everyone in there is really tough!
Rosaline: I went back to basics and was training at the White Treehollow. It made me remember the simple joys of Pokémon battling, the way I felt when I'd just started my journey. VAR(256, 0), did you find anything important when you were battling there?
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
Grace: So you're VAR(256, 0), then? My grandson was all excited about this amazing Trainer, so I finally came to see for myself! I thought you'd look scary, but... Actually, you're quite a cutie!
       
       
       
Muwaaaan!

Ho! Hoo! Welcome to White Forest! In White Forest, people live in harmony with nature and with Pokémon. Please listen to the voice of the forest and of the White Treehollow. They're saying “Bienvenue!" Ho! Hoo! Hoo!
Ho! Hoo! It seems as if you have heard the voice of the White Treehollow. But you can't hear its true voice until you go to the deepest part. Come now, do your best! Ho! Hoo! Hoo!
Ho! Hoo! Hoo! It seems as if you have heard the voice of the White Treehollow's heart. Please let me hear it... No, wait! Things like these shouldn't be heard from someone else! If I want to hear the true voice, I should go to the deepest part on my own. Well, I guess I'll just have to do my best, then! Ho! Hoo! Hoo!
When people build too many tall buildings, the sky gets smaller, and you can't see the sun anymore!
I want to know about how Pokémon feel, so I live in nature with them.
If you know how delicious a meal of Berries can be, you don't have to worry about wanting to eat this and that!

Ah...ah...achoo! I can't stop sneezing. Spring is here, huh? Blech... What in the...? You there! You were just looking at me, right?! When eyes meet, it's a fight! ...In other words, you just picked a fight with me, Nimbasa's Feral Liepard! I hope you've got insurance! Ready?
Harrumph... You've got guts, I'll give you that. You're gonna regret this as you go limping back to the Pokémon Center!
Lame! You're bolting? What a pathetic excuse for a guy!
Whaa! How could I have lost! Aaagh! I could just scream! All right then, let's see what you're really made of. We'll ride this old, run-down Ferris wheel, which puts the “F" in frail. The first one to get scared loses! OK. Let's ride!
... What... What... Stop lookin' at me... ...Tsk! OK! OK! All right already. I'll let you go this time. Next time, you're going down! Don't forget it!
Ah...ah...achoo! Achoo! Achoo! Ah, my nose won't stop running! What?! You there! You're looking at me again? Do you need something? You got a crush on me? Seriously, just lemme alone! Aagh! I'm so embarrassed! Don't bother a sweet, innocent damsel like me in a moment of weakness! I owe you for last time, too. You're gonna pay! You ready? Huh?
Sheesh... You can sure fight. Next time, you're going down! I'm going to crush you! Crush, crush, crush you!
Huh? What?! You're running? I can't believe you'd stoop to that!
Oh, man... Again... This is awful! I seriously can't take any more of these tests of courage. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Over there! It's my hoodlum hero! It's the living legend of larceny, the one who once took down an entire group of Conkeldurr, the Foongus! I can't go talk to the Foongus after losing to a brat like you! All right! There's no other option! I'm a woman! Show me your worst! You! It's on! Get on that Ferris wheel! I ain't getting scared this time!
Aaarrrgh... That's seriously annoying. At least the Foongus is long gone. I got away without my lameness being seen. But, either way, I lost! Tch. You! I've had it! I admit I lost! You're Nimbasa's Feral Liepard now! But don't you dare tell the Foongus about what happened today! Don't think I've forgiven you, either! Someday, I'm gonna make you bawl! Never forget that! Seriously!
Yawn. Every day, I'm sure sleepy. Hey, what are you looking at me for? Could you be a fan of mine? I'm sorry, but today's my first day off in some time. Could you leave me alone? Well, I guess I could have a battle with you. Would that be enough?
Thanks for understanding! It's nice to have such great fans. Let me introduce my beloved Pokémon!
OK. You don't need one! See you then!
Er, VAR(256, 0)? Did I get that right? You rocked the house! Sorry about the mistake! So you're not a fan of mine? Man... Dirk and the Darumakas still have a ways to go then... Well, whatever. Since we're here, let's go and ride the Ferris wheel!
Wh-what? Why are you asking if something's wrong? I'm OK! I'm OK! This just reminded me of a good memory. Anyway, thanks, VAR(256, 0). I had a nice time on a rare day off, and it's all thanks to you. If I get another day off, I might stop by again. See ya, VAR(256, 0)!
Hey! If it isn't VAR(256, 0)! How are you and your Pokémon doing? I've got a show after this, but I felt like you might be coming, so I've been passing time here. Hey, VAR(256, 0)! If you've got a little time, want to hang out for a bit? Um...for starters, how about a Pokémon battle?
Oh, seriously? Thanks! You're awesome! I'm going to come at you with everything I've got! Hit me with your best!
Oh... Didn't mean to cause trouble. Well, when you're free, give me a shout sometime. See ya, VAR(256, 0)!
Aww, man... I get it! You're definitely tough, VAR(256, 0). Are you aiming to be the Champion, too? Uh, sorry about that. It was nothing. Just talking to myself. Anyway, let's go ride the Ferris wheel! The view is really nice and makes you feel really mellow!
Was it about two years ago? Right around here I made a friend at this Ferris wheel. We'd battle, but I could never win. It always made me feel like I had to work harder, and it really motivated me! That's why I made my dance team. Hey, sorry... I didn't mean to go on about someone you've never met while we're hanging out. But you know what? Something about you makes me think about those times... The fact that you're really strong is part of it--that's for sure. All right! Thanks! Let's hang out again! See ya, VAR(256, 0)!
Phew... It's so hot every day lately... Oh, my. What's wrong, dear? Are you lost? I guess you're a little old for that. Well, what do you need, then? Would you like to have a Pokémon battle?
I specialize in taking care of Pokémon more than I do battling with them... Well, why not? I'm feeling a little down, and it would be a nice change of pace.
Oh, well. OK, then. See you.
Wow... Your Pokémon are sure strong. I can tell you've raised them with care. Tee hee. I work at a preschool taking care of kids and Pokémon, so I can tell how a Pokémon is feeling! Well, recently, I've been so tired that it feels like I'm up to my ears in Pokémon... But, that's enough of that. There has to be some reason we met. Let's spend a little more time together! C'mon! Come with me!
Hee hee... That was so fun! You know... My job is taking care of kids and Pokémon in place of busy Trainers. So, for example, if a Pokémon I'm watching gets hurt while playing, when the Trainer comes to pick it up, the Trainer will go after us without even listening to what happened... I know you love your Pokémon, but you're completely different... When I talk to you, I feel like Pokémon Trainers are pretty great. It makes me happy. Thank you! See you again!
Oh! Hi, VAR(256, 0)! How are you? How have you been? Do you have some time? There's something I want to talk to you about!
Yay! Thanks, VAR(256, 0)! But... Just talking is a little boring for you, isn't it? How about we play a little? My Pokémon is in pretty good condition today!
Is that so? That's a shame... Well, if you have time, let me know!
Boy, that was fun! I'd love to just play like this and quit my job... You know what? I was watching a Pokémon yesterday, and I got yelled at by a Trainer. Hey, VAR(256, 0). What do you think about Pokémon getting hurt battling one another? I feel like those are important experiences, but recently I just don't know anymore. ...Well, there's time to complain later. Let's ride the Ferris wheel!
Hmm... Summer isn't the best season to ride this Ferris wheel. Huh? Are you OK, VAR(256, 0)? Your face is as red as a Pansear! It's OK if you roll up your sleeves, you know. Don't be embarrassed. Here, I'll roll up my sleeves, too. I have to do that a lot at work. Working with kids is messy, but I love it! I almost didn't get the job, though. They were looking for someone with more experience. But I knew I could do it! I begged and pleaded, so they said I could start as a volunteer and learn the ropes for a while. I took them up on it! I wanted this job THAT much. I guess if I don't try harder, it will really be a waste. Hee hee. Thanks, VAR(256, 0)! I feel much better about my job now.
Aaaaah! It's sooo hot! How are you so full of energy when it's so hot? What? What's wrong? Do you want to ride the Ferris wheel? Or do you want to battle? I don't care either way, but I'm not very tough.
Hmmm... I see. Shall we begin then? I'm just hanging around anyway.
Oh. I see... Well, be seeing you. Be careful not to get heatstroke!
See? I'm not very good, right? Recently, I've been busy with work, and I don't have time for Pokémon. Thanks, though. I actually had fun. That was a nice way to relieve stress. I don't know if this is a good way to say thanks, but I'll treat you to a Ferris-wheel ride.
How is this Ferris wheel? There's no air conditioning, and it's really worn out, right? Actually, my company is running this Ferris wheel. It's old, and customers don't come anymore. It's in a secluded place where people can get into trouble, so the authorities say it's bad for safety. For our company, it's just a burden, and we actually plan to tear it down. But for the time being, it will stay, so come again if you have time.
Hey there! How have you been doing? Truth is, I was waiting for you. Could you do me a favor and battle me again? Then, I'd like to ride the Ferris wheel again. The rule is you have to have two people to ride, and I don't have anyone to ride with me.
You don't mind? Thanks. I thought you'd turn me down because you might think a sudden request like this is creepy... As the one who invited you, maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but you need to be a bit more cautious in this world. ...Well, then. Let's have a Pokémon battle to start off with.
I see. Well, that's perfectly reasonable. If you think about it, it's kinda creepy, making such a sudden request. But, anyway, let me know if you change your mind.
Hmm. I thought I might lose... Well, that's OK. I'm not the type to obsess about winning anyway. Now I feel more relaxed. Shall we ride the Ferris wheel?
Hmmm... On a thing like THIS, huh... Oh... I'm sorry. Just thinking out loud. Truth is, I just happened to be talking to my mom and dad about this old Ferris wheel. The two of them got all excited, and they told me this is where they had their first date. They said that if it wasn't for this Ferris wheel, I wouldn't exist. Hearing that made me feel really bad... But, things have changed since my parents were young. Hurrying and tearing this Ferris wheel down would be for the best. Before we tear it down, though, I wanted to look at the scenery and think about my mom and dad's youth... Thanks for riding with me. OK. Take care!
The wind has become colder... I wonder if the doctor will be upset with me for being out too long... Huh? Who are you? Do you want to battle, perhaps?
You're a funny one. Wanting to battle an old lady like me! Hee hee hee... But it's nice of you to invite me. OK. Let's have a good battle.
I see... Well, be well.
Aww... That was over in an instant. Sorry. I'm not very good. VAR(256, 0), was it? Have you ever ridden this Ferris wheel? The view is really really pretty. But, it's a little odd--two people have to ride in one car. Um... Talking about it makes me want to ride it again... Hey, come ride with me!
Hee hee... That was a lot of fun... I might not look like it, but I'm a mom. Well, I should say I'll be a mom soon. Recently, the doctor's been telling me to take it easy, and I'm a little stressed out. But today, I managed to relax enough for two. Thanks, VAR(256, 0). I hope we can meet again sometime.
Why hello, VAR(256, 0)! How are you? Do you want to battle again?
Hee hee hee... Sure thing. I have to build up strength for the little bundle of joy inside me. But, I'm not supposed to do anything strenuous, so take it easy on me, OK?
I see... I was expecting a fun battle, but...
Hee hee hee... I just can't keep up! Still, you have such a cool expression, but when you battle, it's rather wild! I think guys like that are great. You definitely would've been my type when I was younger. Well now, VAR(256, 0). Since you're here, hang out with this old lady a little longer!
Hee hee. That was fun... You're good at Pokémon, and you're really wonderful. You remind me of that person. I hope my child grows up to be a nice kid like you, VAR(256, 0). I have to work very hard to make that happen! See you, VAR(256, 0)! I had a great time! Thanks!
My sentiment doesn't stop at each falling leaf... Huh? What do you want, girl? Do you want something from me? It looks like you're a Trainer. Are you asking me to battle?
Harrumph. I have zero interest in girls like you, but I accept your challenge. Shall we get this over with?
Really... Then leave me alone.
Ah... I can't stand it... Every time I have a Pokémon battle, memories of that summer pull at my heart and tear it apart. That's right... You. Meeting you here must be fate. Will you listen to how I ended up this way? I hear telling someone what makes your heart ache eases the pain. My painful, painful memories of love... I don't want anyone else to hear them. Come here with me...
Sniff... Ex-excuse me. Just remembering that summer makes it hard to hold back the tears... Tore me up inside, and when that person disappeared... Of course I was betrayed... But still, my heart is still not used to it... I'm sorry... But I want to be alone for a moment...
Oh... It's you. I'm sorry. VAR(256, 0), wasn't it? How are you? Doing well? Honestly, I'm still the same. My shaking heart is still waiting for the rescue squad to save it... If you don't mind, could you spare a moment. Please?
Really? Thank you... But, shall we have a battle first... I have to be able to have a decent Pokémon battle by now...
Oh... Sorry about the trouble...
It's no good! No good at all!! It's like I can't concentrate at all!! Why is this empty, too? Why do I keep remembering? Why can't I forget that summer? Why?! Why can't I forget that sunshine?! Excuse me for losing control. Wait just one moment... I'm picking up the pieces of my broken heart... So, VAR(256, 0)... Can you stay with me a little longer?
Sniff... Sob... You know, VAR(256, 0)... Love and breakups are sure hard... But, do you know what I think... Even if something is waiting ahead, you should tell the person that you have feelings in your heart... You don't have to worry about being hurt. If you give up on telling people how you feel because you're afraid you can't be together... All that's waiting on that flat line of fear is eternal loneliness. ... Thanks for listening to me. You're a girl, but our souls are on the same wavelength. You're a true friend...
Who are you? Do you want to battle me?
Hmm... They must be getting desperate-- sending a kid like you... They really want to take me back to the manor, don't they? Well, if I think of what I'm worth, that's to be expected... Fine! I'll be your opponent in a Pokémon battle! Now listen. In exchange, if you lose, you will get out of my sight immediately!
Would you be off, then?! I really don't like kids...
Who ARE you? I've never seen you at the manor. It doesn't seem like you're a member of an organization or a hospital... Could it be? Did you just want to battle? Or did you want to ride the Ferris wheel and talk? Well, OK then! Let's ride the Ferris wheel. Come now, hurry!
What a relief... If you weren't such an honest person, that might have been your end... That's right... I'm being targeted by his organization. ... Oh, that's fine. You don't need to believe me. But just listen to this. If I'm safe, the world will be at peace tomorrow as well... If not... You should hope that we both can meet again.
Why if it isn't VAR(256, 0)? Oh! That's it! Stay with me for a moment! Why? For a Pokémon battle of course! A simple Pokémon battle! The people they have chasing me are getting tougher recently... Think of it as helping me out. Will you battle with me?
You... You have a lot of promise.
Fine then! Go away, then! If they see you with me, you'll be in danger, too!
You're just as good as ever. You should be able to defend yourself with no trouble. I'll be OK! That fight made me stronger, and I always take care of myself... Always have... Always will... Come now, let's ride the Ferris wheel. Even they can't strike there.
World peace is protected by something truly simple... It's best if you don't know any more than that... If you know, that organization will come after you as well... But, it's OK. As you live out each day, I'll try to stay one step ahead of them. Well let's hope we can see each other again someday. Then when you become an adult, together we can... No. I'm sorry... I shouldn't make promises I can't keep. Now, go!
Yeah! You over there! Wearing those cold-lookin' threads in the middle of winter is pretty rock 'n' roll! But listen, there ain't anyone who rocks harder than me! Let's have a battle and prove who rocks hardest! Yeeeooow!
OK! Hard-rock grrrl! Prepare to be rocked by my beat!
You're just gonna rock 'n' roll away? That's not cool, grrrl!
Whoo hoo! Way to rock, grrrl! No one can stop your hard-rockin' heart! Hey! To thank you for the funky battle, I'll sing you a song! I can't give it away here! My beats are premium! This is a song for you alone! Hey! Roll on over this way! Yeeoow!
How was it, hard-rock grrl? My rockin' music bowl you over? I dropped a heartbreaking beat in a country style about the unending yearning heart of a sad woman who has lost love. It's a tragic masterpiece! That's it for today. I'll end with an ad! I'm playing streets all over the world right now! I'll be here for a while! I'm waiting for your encore!
Hey! It's...rocki... No. How are you? Is that so. Please excuse me for interrupting your busy day, but would you be so kind as to have a battle with me?
Thank you very much for accepting my challenge... Gr... Excuse me. Please come at me with everything you have.
Oh. That's unfortunate. I'm very sorry to have stopped you when you were busy...
Thank you so much... I knew you rocked... Excuse me, but I think you're wonderful. ... ...Truth is, the other day after we parted, I was scouted, and my producer offered me a massive debut. But that's... Actually, before I continue, I want to ask you a favor, VAR(256, 0). Please listen to my song again!
How was my song? ... Well, to continue my story, I'm supposed to debut as a sweet and pure pop singer. They listened to my songs but said they wouldn't be popular now. Even more, they said I should speak more politely. This isn't me... But I may never get a chance like this again. I can't let it pass me by... So I'm going to change. I'll be cute, pretty, and classy so everyone will love me... But, VAR(256, 0), let me be the real me in front of you! I'll sing that song just for you... So, VAR(256, 0), please come and meet me sometime!
You can only ride this Ferris wheel with two people. Too bad. I wanted to tell my sister about it... Hey. Wait a minute! Ride with me!
OK! I'm gonna brag about this to my sister!
What? You came here because of the Ferris wheel, right?!
That was a nice change of pace. Time to get back to work and train!
It's sure big! I bet if you ride it, you can see really far away! Think you can see Nuvema Town? Hey, c'mon! Ride with me!
This sure makes me smile! See you!
Hee hee! We're already here! Let's ride!
That was so much fun! See yooou!
VAR(48649, 1)This sure takes me back... You! Ride this Ferris wheel with me!VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)...That made me remember that day. ...Sorry. I'll be going.VAR(48649, 0)

Now that you mention it, I've been to Nimbasa City many times, but I've never ridden the Ferris wheel.
Everything is an experience. Thanks for riding with me. That's a big help.
Well... In order to put what's good about Ferris wheels into words, the only thing to do is ride one.
The scenery changes along with the movement of the Ferris wheel, but I prefer it when things stay the same.
Oh, VAR(256, 0)! You came! I'm so glad. ... ... What? N-no! I haven't been waiting. I just got here a minute ago. Ah ha ha! Hey, if you don't mind, do you want to ride the Ferris wheel? Nimbasa City's Ferris wheel is really famous for having a beautiful view. ... ... Really? You don't mind? Great! I've been wanting to ride this Ferris wheel for a long time! But... Only two people can ride it, so I've held out this whole time! I'm so happy, I'm all worked up! Let's hurry up and ride, VAR(256, 0)!
... Ah ha ha! I'm so thankful for everything you've done for me. I feel like I can work so hard at this job thanks to you, VAR(256, 0). I'd like it if we could keep talking from time to time... ... OK. I'm going to get going... Today was a lot of fun! See you later, VAR(256, 0)!
Oh! VAR(256, 0)! Ah ha ha! I couldn't wait, so I hurried here. I'm happy to see you! Hey, would you like to ride the Ferris wheel with me? I've taken a bit of a shine to it. ... Really? That's great! Why did I get so excited all of the sudden. Let's hurry and ride, VAR(256, 0)!
... Thanks for coming today. I was really happy you invited me. Being with you again has given me a lot of energy! Ah ha ha! Now I have energy for work! If you don't mind, I'd like it if you invite me again! Well, I'd better get going! See you, VAR(256, 0)!

Hey, VAR(256, 0). When I was in a different region for work, I caught VAR(257, 1)... Will you trade me one of your Pokémon? I'll take any Pokémon. I just want to trade!
Thank you! VAR(257, 1) also looks happy!
Oh. That's too bad. If we have another opportunity, let's trade Pokémon, OK?

VAR(256, 0) handed over Yancy's Dropped Item!
Thank you, VAR(256, 0). I'm sorry I couldn't find the time to pick it up earlier. But I really enjoyed talking with you, so maybe I was a little lucky! Ah ha ha... Um... If you don't mind can I still call you sometime? ... Phew. I was really scared you might say no.
Reregistered Yancy in the Xtransceiver!
Can I ask you one more thing? I called you on the Xtransceiver too often, and Ma... I mean one of my coworkers... got really mad at me... So, VAR(256, 0), could you call me? ... What? Really? Thanks... VAR(256, 0), you're really nice. Hee hee... I'm usually at work, and sometimes I have trouble picking up a signal... But I'd like it if you check your Xtransceiver often and give me a call... Ah ha ha! Well, I'll be heading home! Good-bye, VAR(256, 0)!
No! I'm not who you think! ...What? You're VAR(256, 0)? I'm so sorry! I thought you were someone else. Well, uh... I guess, um, nice to meet you! I'm Curtis! You were different than I imagined, so I was a little surprised... Ah ha ha... ... I suppose so! We can just talk normally!

Challenge
Info

A Random Matchup is a battle with other Pokémon fans from around the world. There are five kinds of Random Matchups: Single, Double, Triple, Rotation, and Launcher. Also, Random Matchups have two modes: Free mode and Rating mode. In Free mode, everyone can participate in battles freely. In Rating mode, you may participate in battles after you set Game Sync, access the Pokémon Global Link website with your computer, and register your Game Sync ID. http://www.pokemon-gl.com/ (Pokémon Global Link)
Would you like to know more details?
Free Mode
Rating Mode
Special Rules
Understood
Free mode is for casual battles against other Pokémon fans around the world. Feel free to challenge it!
Rating mode is recommended for those who want to master battles. When communication is established, you are likely to battle against a person with a similar Rating. Your Rating starts at 1500. When you win, it goes up. When you lose, it goes down. So the higher your Rating is, the stronger you are as a Trainer! There's one thing you should be careful about in Rating mode. Your record and Rating will be erased if you connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with a different DS System. So please be careful if you switch!
There are several special rules for Random Matchups. Any Pokémon higher than Lv. 50 will be set to that level for the battle. Pokémon nicknames won't be used. You have a limited time to choose Pokémon for a battle and to give orders to your Pokémon during the battle. Don't exceed the time limit, or your Pokémon and its moves will be chosen for you! There's also a time limit on the battle. The winner will be determined when time runs out, even if both sides still have Pokémon standing.
