Hi! I am a humble Maid! My master has a big heart to match his big belly. He's a gourmet! So I am looking for ingredients that will make his heart jump for joy!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff... Oh, that aroma! It smells so gourmet! Do you have a wonderful ingredient in your Bag? Would you consider selling it to me?
Oh, it smells so good! That VAR(265, 0) of yours is a very rare ingredient indeed! Would you take $VAR(519, 1) for it?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
Merci! Thank you!! With this, I can create a superb menu. My master will be so surprised!
Hmmm... This is not quite what I'm looking for. I don't think my master will be satisfied with such a smell...
Aww... Well, that's OK. If you find a gourmet ingredient for me, please let me know!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff... Well, I don't smell anything interesting in your Bag. But if you find a gourmet ingredient, please let me know!
Ore, ore, ore... Ores that I adore! Ah, this is where you should laugh... Anyway... I will pay you well for rare ores. And not just ores! Stones, gems, shards...anything mineral! I love it all!
Don't you have an adorable ore that shakes my core?
Oh, I do adore the ores! That VAR(265, 0), it's shaking me! Will you sell it for $VAR(519, 1)?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
The deal is done! I've scored an ore I can adore!
Huh? What on earth is this? You can't shake my core with an ore so poor!
Hmmm. My core won't change. I hope you sell it to me someday.
Don't you have an adorable ore that shakes my core? Hmmmm. You don't seem to have it. Come back again.
As you can see, I am an ultrarich billionaire! And as you can see, my hobby is to collect rare items! In fact, this outfit is ultra expensive and rare. Can you see it? Can you?
There's something that this billionaire wants to get his hands on, even if it means spending a lot of money. Do you have such a rare item? Do you?
That VAR(265, 0)!! Will you sell it to me for $VAR(519, 1)? Will you?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
I got a very good item! Don't you think it's great? Don't you?
This is slightly different. Don't you think so, too? Don't you?
If you ever change your mind, will you sell me the rare item? Will you?
Actually, it's... It's a rare treasure, Relic Crown! I was told it was at the innermost part of the Abyssal Ruins! I think it is understandable that you want to treasure it, but will you sell it to me for $VAR(519, 1)? Will you?
There's something that this billionaire wants to get his hands on, even if it means spending a lot of money. Do you have such a rare item? Do you? Grrr! You don't have a rare item, do you?
Hey, check it out. I've got a sweet deal for ya! You know how Pokémon like to hide behind stones or rocks, yeah? Sometimes they hide cool stuff, too. If you find something cool behind a rock, you should bring it to me. I'll make it worth your while.
What's up? Did you find something cool for me?
Hey, nice! Let me check out that VAR(265, 0)... I'll give you $VAR(519, 1) for it. Whaddaya say?
Turned over the VAR(265, 0) and received $VAR(519, 1)!
Hey, thanks! I bet I can sell this to a collector for way more than I just gave you. Ha! That's business for ya!
Nope, this is no good. Not worth my while.
Hey, come see me if you find something cool, got it? I'll make it worth your while.
What's up? Did you find something cool for me? ...Nope, nothing cool in your Bag. Oh well. Maybe next time!

Leo: Check me out! The excitement of the big city has made me stronger!
Looks like I wasn't wound up enough... I need a little more urban atmosphere.
Maybe all of this excitement is a little too much for me...
Living in a fast-paced environment helps with a person's growth. This city is a model for those words.
Silvia: My glasses have locked onto you! Let's have a Pokémon battle!
Th-there’s a crack in my glasses. That was a smashing battle!
The time I've spent here has been really fun and wonderful! But, being this surrounded by excitement makes you miss nature somehow!
All the buildings reflected in my glasses are dazzling enough to make me dizzy!
Dave: Hey! You've got it goin' on! Let's get a Pokémon battle goin' to see who's got it goin' on the most!
No one's got it goin' on more than you! You can hang out with all the tough guys!
The life of a tough guy in the city is a little much. White Forest is looking better all the time.
This city is big and tough, just like me! What do you think of me now? I've got it goin' on as much as it will go! Right?
Britney: Hey there! You over thataway! Have a Pokémon battle with me! Bring heaps of cute Pokémon, OK?
Whoa, what was that?! You are way strong! There's no chance I'm keepin' up!
All the racket in this city is getting to be too much. I want to lie on my back in the wide-open spaces!
I have to try somethin' awful to keep up with city life! But I still enjoy it a bit.
Robbie: In Black City, my groove's getting into a groove! And in battle, I'll never lose!
Ooh, now I'm grooveless. But I'll get my groove back, so let's battle again sometime!
Aaah! I've grooved my way into a rut! I want to take a break in White Forest!
Developing and developing. Black City changes every day! I love that about this place!
Miki: Hello! I'm a fan of sudden beginnings! Let's get right to the Pokémon battle!
Oh, gosh. I already lost? Sudden endings, I'm not such a fan of!
It's too busy and noisy, and it's enough to make a slow-paced person like me dizzy. I want to relax in White Forest.
I was worried, since I'm a little laid back and do things at my own speed, that Black City and I aren't a good fit. But it'll work out, and it's fun here!
Ryder: Hyah! Hello! I want to test my strength against you! That's OK, right?
Huh... So that's how much I've improved. Thanks! Battling with you has given me a goal!
Hyah! Hyah... Hyah? My heart's not really into it. Maybe I just can't concentrate here.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!! Since strong people gather here, it's the optimal place for a test of strength!
Karenna: Faster! Faster! I'm ready to go! Please spar with me!
Thank you very much! I still haven't trained enough. I need to be faster!
There are many things to learn from battle, but to improve on what I learned, I want to run and train in the forest.
There is a lot to learn from battles! I want to battle more and more!
Doug: Hello, hello! Nice to work with you! How about a Pokémon battle to celebrate our new acquaintance?
Hey! You must be Unova's best!
Black City has everything! But if there's one thing it's missing, it's... Nature! Relaxation! I want to relax!
Black City is full of hustle and bustle! I'm sure my work will progress here!
Vincent: You don't really think you can beat me, Black City's Ace Trainer?
An Ace Trainer like me, losing?! This doesn't count! It just doesn't!
I was born and raised in the city, but I think nature is really great. I want to go to White Forest.
The awesomeness of this city spices up my life!
Marie: Take deep, deep breaths before battle. When your mind is clear, the battle can begin!
I overthought things, and I lost... Sometimes just acting on instinct might be better.
I was working on my paper, but now I've got writer's block. Maybe getting some fresh air in White Forest would clear my head.
Black City is really exciting, and there's always so much going on. It gives me lots of ideas!
Lena: Since I started my journey as a Pokémon Trainer, I haven't lost many battles. Can you make me lose?
Oh. I really lost, didn't I...? It's strange. I'm usually calm, but now I'm a little frustrated.
In the end, everything returns to nature, no matter what. So that's why White Forest may be so calming...
People build buildings because they fear the power of nature. That's why I feel so calm here...
Carlos: Oh! Hello! We must've met here because of fate! Let's have a Pokémon battle!
Black City battles really make a person excited, huh?
Hmmm. I think I'd like to see somewhere else soon.
Black City has so much to see. I never get tired of it!
Molly: If you look at everything while walking, you make eye contact with various Trainers. Which Pokémon will you use, Trainer who met my gaze?
When you don't feel confident, lower your eyes as you walk. That is a bit of wisdom.
When there is this much commotion, it's hard to calm down. I want to relax somewhere quiet.
Black City always feels like it is going forward. It's really cool, isn't it?
Frederic: Oh! Have a look at this! My Pokémon is saying it wants to battle with yours!
My Pokémon is saying that was a good battle. Don't you think my Pokémon is truly well mannered?
I love this place, but my Pokémon seems unsatisfied. Maybe I should take it to White Forest.
This is definitely the best place for me. The constant change and development really put me in high spirits.
Lynette: How do you do? Would you please let me see if you are strong or not?
Ah, you are a strong person! I can feel it in my heart.
I've grown a little tired of looking for my Prince Charming.
There are many strong people in this city, so I never get bored! I want to meet more and more strong people!
Pierce: Phew! What a thrilling lifestyle! Want to taste the thrill with a Pokémon battle?
That felt like being on the edge! It was thrilling and fun!
Aaahhh. I'm even getting tired of thrilling things. I want to pass time slowly and simply with my Pokémon...
Black City is great. It has culture, and you can live comfortably. I think when you're picking a place to live, living comfortably is important!
Gene: I can't remember how many Pokémon I've encountered... Why don't you test your powers against someone like me?
Hmmm... I still have a long way to go as a Trainer.
I want to meet more Pokémon in my day-to-day life.
You can keep battling more and more and test your power here! Black City is a great city!
Piper: Fight efficiently and without waste! That is my policy!
Your efficient fighting style is truly wonderful!
Maybe there's more to life than efficiency...
Efficiency is everything in battling and in business. Black City is efficient. I like that in a place!
Miho: I'm adorable, and so is my Pokémon! Do you think you can win against us?
How can we lose when we're so cute?
I've been thinking lately that it would be better for my Pokémon and me to get back to nature...
You can get everything in Black City, so I'm sure I can find things that will help me become cuter and stronger!
Shane: You strong? I'm sure you are! I'll check by battling with you!
I see... I must be weak, then...
I'm a little tired of living a life where I'm worried about how people see me.
In Black City, I can always confirm what kind of guy I am by battling others. It's easy to understand.
Ralph: My feelings! I'll use a Pokémon battle to get them through!
Did some of my excitement get through to you?
Recently, I've been thinking I don't just want to try and get my feelings through to people, but I also want to listen a little better... I want to live the slow life in White Forest.
In Black City, you can quickly let me know how you feel! This directness feels really great!
Eliza: I want this! I want that! But what I really want is to beat you in a Pokémon battle!
My oh my... I lost!
Even if I buy a lot of stuff, I'm still unsatisfied... I have times like that!
In Black City, you can get whatever you want! You can live securely!
Collin: Pokémon battles are good for business! I'll defeat you and take advantage of the business opportunity!
My business opportunity! It's going up in smoke!!
Business opportunities don't just come rolling your way... Maybe White Forest is a better fit for me...
Time is limited! I want to always give things my all so I don't regret anything!
Ken: I've dedicated my life to Pokémon battling. I will win as a specialist!
I apparently still haven't done enough research on Pokémon battling.
All I think about every day is Pokémon battling. But maybe it would be better to think about other things, too... I think that sometimes.
If I'm in Black City, I can focus on Pokémon battling and get really good! I'll try to master one thing!
Jacques: Win or lose! Contests have a clear answer! I'm going to research your battling style.
The result is a loss. It's a beautiful, clear answer.
Just one answer... I think there may be a way of research that looks for something besides that.
In Black City, you can get a clear answer if you battle... It's satisfying for a researcher.
Rosa: Life is just killing time. Don't you think so? Play with me for a bit!
I managed to kill some time!
I might not know what to do with a life of killing time every day!
Black City has lots of ways to kill time, so I never get bored! It's great!!
Herman: I can't be tied down to a single place... I wander around, and today's another battle!
I lost! This city doesn't fit me well.
Just staying in one place... I'd like to try living like that.
Wandering and having Pokémon battles! I like living like this!
Emi: Pokémon battling... That is the goal for my journey!
I couldn't win! But this is one of the thrills of battling!
Recently, I've been thinking I would like to take a more leisurely trip without any particular destination in mind.
In Black City, I can enjoy Pokémon battles, and it fits my journey perfectly!
Grace: I am about to show you the beauty of artistic Pokémon battling! Please be overwhelmed!
The combination of you and your Pokémon was very beautiful!!
There is a limit to the beauty a person can create... I feel like that when I look at this city.
My heart dances in delight at the calculated beauty of a city built by people!
Black City Prosperous and Vibrant

Welcome to Black City. This is the city of dreams, greed, and more greed. And I am Black City's boss, so I'm a whirlpool of greed!
This city is filled with vibrant people who are like big piles of greed. Hmm. Try defeating VAR(516, 0) of the people outside. Then I'll respond to your greed.
I see you've defeated VAR(516, 1) of them. Hmph. Keep trying.
What? You've already beaten VAR(516, 0) people? You... You're a greedier one than I expected. Deep down, you want a lot. I like you! I'll respond to your greed.

I want to become more powerful and make more money!
If you have the money, you can get anything you want in this city!
This city has everything! Absolutely everything!
Hmmm... Isn't there a better job where I can make more money?
I wonder how strong this Pokémon could become...
Everything I want is here! If I only had money! If only!
The power of civilization is amazing... We can make anything people could want!
Hee hee! Let's have a Rotation Battle!
Prepare three Pokémon for battle, OK? Rotation Battle is a new kind of battle that uses three Pokémon at a time!
Heh! Scared of me, aren't you?!
Rotation Battles are shocking!
I just got lucky and got some Pokémon here... I want to use them right now, so let's have a Rotation Battle!
Rotation Battles use three Pokémon! So get three of yours ready!
Scared of how lucky I am, huh?
Hmmmph. I only lost today because I got unlucky.

Hey there! I'm Fennel. Professor Juniper asked me to give you something. Please, follow me!
Are you looking for the Gym Leader? He is not here. He could be in the Trainers' School. If you want to challenge him, please go find him. The Trainers' School is not far from this Gym.
Yes? Yes, I am a Gym Leader of this town. You are...? Right. You want to challenge the Gym. In that case... What was the first Pokémon you chose? VAR(257, 0)... I see. It's weak against VAR(259, 1)-type Pokémon. I think you need to prepare to face that type. I'll be waiting for you inside.
Yes? Yes, I am a Gym Leader of this town. You are...? Right. You want to challenge the Gym. In that case... What was the first Pokémon you chose? VAR(257, 0)... I see. It's weak against VAR(259, 1)-type Pokémon. I think you need to prepare to face that type. For example, try training your Pokémon in the Dreamyard. Please excuse me now.
You don't seem to have any Gym Badges, so I can't let you by. With your lack of training, you'll have a hard job making any progress. Let me give you some friendly advice. Challenge a Gym Leader in this town, and test your ability!
You don't seem to have any Gym Badges. With your lack of experience, you'll have a hard time in the future. Here's some friendly advice. Challenge a Gym Leader in this town, and test your ability!
The scientist Fennel was looking for you a little while ago!
The scientist Fennel was looking for you a little while ago!
Wow! It's a shiny Gym Badge! Getting that Badge proved you have skill enough to handle whatever comes next!
The Striaton City Gym Leader. No matter how often I challenge him, he always uses Pokémon that I don't like...
If a Pokémon type and a move type are the same, the move's power will increase! The Gym Leader told me!
At the site of an old factory, at a place we call the Dreamyard, there's an unusual Pokémon that can make dreams appear!
I too studied at the Trainers' School when I was a beginner.
Do you know how Technical Machines work? A TM can instantly teach a move to a Pokémon. You can use it over and over with different Pokémon. How cool is that?
Er... Um... Grass-type Pokémon are weak against Fire-type moves. I know more stuff!
Er... Um... Water-type Pokémon are weak against Grass-type moves. I know more stuff!
Um... Er... Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type moves. I know more stuff!
Some Trainers train themselves and their Pokémon in the Dreamyard. You might think about going there... Could be you'll find something...
I'm so glad you came. I'd like to give you this!
To live quietly and do a lot of fishing... I truly live my ideal existence!
Pokémon can be found in dark places, too. That's when a Dusk Ball can do the trick! Here's one for you.
A Dusk Ball works well at night or in a cave. Plus, its name is excellent! The Dusk Ball. Dusk!
Striaton City Three Stand Together as One!
Dreamyard ahead. A place for novice Trainers.
Trainers' School Brush up on Pokémon knowledge!
Striaton City Pokémon Gym Leader: --- Triple Trouble!

===============================
Text File: 12
===============================
Welcome to the Striaton City Pokémon Gym.

I'm Chili! I light things up with Fire-type Pokémon!
I'm a Water-type specialist, and my name is Cress. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
And my name is Cilan. I like Grass-type Pokémon.
Cilan: Um, you see... As for why the three of us, um, are all here is, well, er...
Chili: Oh, enough! Listen up! The three of us will decide whom you'll battle! It'll be based on the type of the first Pokémon you chose!
Cress: That is indeed the case. And the partner you first chose was VAR(259, 0) type, it seems.
Ta-da! The Fire-type scorcher Chili-- that's me--will be your opponent!
That is correct! It shall be I and my esteemed Water types that you must face in battle!
Nothing personal... No hard feelings... Me and my Grass-type Pokémon will...um... We're gonna battle, come what may.
Yeeeeooow! Time to play with FIRE!! I'm the strongest of us brothers!
What incredible luck for you--you get to battle the best among the three of us.
So, um, if you're OK with me, I'll, um, put everything I've got into being, er, you know, your opponent.
Aww, man! I was all fired up, too!
How exceedingly lucky for you that you do not have to face me.
...Uh hm. I always seem to lose the timing of...of the dance. Like that. True enough, I did want to... want to have a Pokémon battle with you.
Whoa ho! You're on fire! Well, it's the Pokémon League's rule. Take this Gym Badge!
Why, you're quite remarkable. It's the Pokémon League's rule, so-- please take this Badge.
...What a surprise. You...are very strong. Seems like not even Chili or Cress could beat you...
VAR(256, 0) received the Trio Badge from Chili!
VAR(256, 0) received the Trio Badge from Cress!
VAR(256, 0) received the Trio Badge from Cilan!
Gym Badges are proof of a Trainer's abilities. If you have one Badge, Pokémon, including traded Pokémon up to Lv. 20, will obey you without question. We also want you to have this.
VAR(265, 0) contains Work Up. If you use Work Up, the Pokémon's Attack and Sp. Atk go up! By the way, TMs can be used as many times as you want.
In the Unova region, we are still novice Gym Leaders. Which means the other Gym Leaders are much stronger than we are. We'll need to work hard and improve.
I can't believe TMs can be used over and over! If you wanted, you could use one to teach all your Pokémon the same move!
If there were 17 siblings in the Striaton City Gym... There could be a specialist for each type of Pokémon.
Cilan: In the Unova region, um, we are still novice Gym Leaders. Which means, well, that other Gym Leaders are much stronger than we are. Going...slow...and steady...is OK, so... we compete with one another and get, um, stronger and stronger.
Chili: Oh! It's you! Your fire is more intense than when you got the Trio Badge!
Cress: ...We heard about the incident with N's Castle. If we had received the message in time, the three of us could have helped.
Hello! I'm Clyde. I'm the guide for Trainers challenging a Pokémon Gym. We appreciate your challenging the Gym. Take this to commemorate the occasion.
One basic element of Pokémon battles is the relationship between types. If you choose Pokémon with effective types and effective moves, victory is just a step away! In this Gym, you proceed by stepping on the switch with the type that is effective against the Pokémon type shown on the curtain.
I hope you'll always remember the incredible moment when you received this Gym Badge.
Welcome! We are very proud of our menu, which we adjust to suit each Trainer!

I've just learned that the more Gym Badges you win, the more items you can buy at a shop!
Have you been catching Pokémon? When you have more Pokémon, you're less likely to lose in battles, and it's more fun to look at your Pokédex and PC Box!

===============================

===============================
Fennel: You're going to meet all of the Pokémon in the Unova region. Am I right? Oh, the stairs are right here!
Fennel: My room is upstairs here. Come on, go upstairs!
After a battle, to my surprise, my Pokémon evolved and changed its appearance!
Some evolve and some don't... Pokémon really are mysterious creatures.
You can't go upstairs now! 'Cause Fennel said she was testing something, and she had a scary look on her face!
She may not look like it, but Fennel is a great scientist!

===============================
Text File: 15
===============================
So like I said, I'm Fennel, and as you can see, I'm a scientist. In fact, the subject I'm researching is Trainers! Professor Juniper is my friend from college. She asked me to help you guys.
So! I'll give you something to help you. This is a Hidden Machine for you!



There are some moves that a Pokémon can use even when it is not fighting! With this Hidden Machine, you can teach your Pokémon a move called Cut. It can cut down a small tree. And you can use the Hidden Machine as many times as you want, like a TM. Isn't that great? But it's difficult to make a Pokémon forget a hidden move once it learns it.
And I'd like to ask you a favor, too! There is a place called the Dreamyard on the outskirts of Striaton City. I'd like some of the Dream Mist that a Pokémon there called Munna gives off. With that, I'll be able to use VAR(65280, 2)Game Sync VAR(65280, 0)to collect save files of various Trainers!
Fennel: Did Juniper ask you to complete the Pokédex? It is a challenge to update the Pokédex regularly, isn't it? Oops! I got distracted! Please bring me some of the Dream Mist that Munna gives off in the Dreamyard!
Fennel: Ta-da! Thanks to you, I got some Dream Mist, and now I can collect save files of various Trainers! Thank you very much! As a token of my appreciation, I will give you this C-Gear to use! The C-Gear is a device related to communications, such as Infrared Connection or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
VAR(256, 0) obtained the VAR(65280, 2)C-GearVAR(65280, 0)!
Turn on the C-Gear and establish communications?
Yes
No
Some functions of the C-Gear will be restricted. Is that OK?
Wireless communications are turned OFF. Turn wireless communications ON in the System Settings. Error code: 50699
You see! The C-Gear was activated, and that screen showed up! If you touch the “?" icon at the bottom-right of the screen, you can read about the C-Gear.
If you want to turn on the C-Gear, touch the Power symbol at the bottom right of the screen. Then, after turning on the power, if you touch the “?" icon at the bottom right of the screen, you can read about the C-Gear.
About VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0)... I'd like to explain a little more about the system to collect Trainers' save files. Do you have time to learn more?
I am sorry! I am so happy, so I will explain about it! Because, thanks to you, we can do a great thing!
Now VAR(65280, 2)Game Sync VAR(65280, 0)can retrieve memories of sleeping Pokémon using Dream Mist! That's right! We can collect save files of Trainers from all over the world!
What's more, we learned that if you use VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0) to make a Pokémon sleep, it will have dreams. Then, when you wake up that Pokémon, its dream becomes the reality in a space called VAR(65280, 1)Entralink VAR(65280, 0)in the middle of the Unova region. Isn't Game Sync interesting? If you like, please send your save file. I've summed up the details in the PC, so please check it if you get a chance!
Fennel: VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0) is fascinating, I think. Do you think so, too? If you get interested, please send your save file. I've summed up the details in the PC at the back. So, please check it, if you'd like!
Fennel: Oh, thank you!  You also sent your save file. I saw it while I was researching Trainers! Isn't VAR(65280, 2)Game SyncVAR(65280, 0) great?


Are you a Trainer? Do you use the PC at Pokémon Centers? I am Amanita. I maintain the Box system. Do you know about the Battle Box?
Amanita: Impressive! If there's a Pokémon you often use in your battles, you can register it in the Battle Box!
Amanita: Let me give you a quick how-to! If there's a Pokémon you often use in your battles, you can register it in the Battle Box!
Amanita: Please do use the Battle Box. You can register Pokémon in the PC over there, too!
Amanita: Oh, Trainer! Thank you very much for helping Fennel! This is from me. Please take it. Don't be shy.
You can register your friends in your Pal Pad. After you register, you can link with those friends over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to do all kinds of fun things! You can trade Pokémon, challenge your friends to a battle, and so on. Let me give you a quick how-to on registering your friends. You can either input your friend's code directly by using your Pal Pad... Or you can use the IR Connection feature of the C-Gear. Then, you can register your friend!
Amanita: Is there something you'd like to ask me?
In the Battle Box, you can register up to six Pokémon that you often use in battles. When you battle using Infrared Connection, you can choose to battle with either your party Pokémon or with the Pokémon in the Battle Box!
In order to register your friend in your Pal Pad... You can either input your friend's code directly by using your Pal Pad... Or you can use the IR Connection feature of the C-Gear. Then, you can register your friend!
Catch a lot of Pokémon, and use the Box a lot!

Game Sync
Pokémon Dreams
Cancel
Game Sync is a system to collect save files from Trainers all over the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection by making Pokémon sleep and retrieving their dreams. Touch the Online button on the C-Gear screen, and a button called VAR(65280, 1)Game Sync VAR(65280, 0)appears. Choose a Pokémon to send to sleep, then you can send your save file through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. You should be able to make more Pokémon sleep as a result of the research.
Pokémon Dreams... If you use Game Sync to make a Pokémon sleep, it will have dreams. When you wake up the Pokémon with Game Sync, its dream becomes the reality in a space called VAR(65280, 1)Entralink VAR(65280, 0)in the middle of the Unova region...

Oh! Trainer! Do you have enough Poké Balls? Don't be shy. Take this with you!
You cannot have too many Poké Balls! My advice is that when you use a better Poké Ball, it's easier to catch Pokémon!
The beginning of my relationship with my wife was our Pokémon battles. I could not defeat her, even though I tried many times!
My husband and I are compatible... because he cannot beat me in battle!

Do your Pokémon have nicknames? When we give a Pokémon a nickname, we grow attached to it. Don't you agree?
I went abroad to have Pokémon battles!
Hi, traveling Trainer! Your family must be talking about you right now!

You can tell how strong Trainers are by the number of Gym Badges they have! If you're a Trainer, you should challenge Gym Leaders and collect a lot of Badges!
Lately, I have a favorite model. Her name is Elesa, and her Pokémon are strong, too!
The GTS! It links the world from the second floor of a Pokémon Center! The full name of the GTS is the Global Trade Station!

I've trained only Fire-type Pokémon, 'cause they're my favorites! But they had no chance in a battle against Water-type Pokémon... Sigh... Maybe I should try to train Pokémon of other types.
It is quite hard to train six Pokémon at once, so I've heard some Trainers focus on training three Pokémon at a time.

He was here talking about Pokémon types until just a few moments ago... Maybe you walked right past him?
Nothing improves your skill as a Trainer like real battles. That's why challenging Gym Leaders is great practice.
By the way, VAR(256, 0), will you have a battle with me? I want to test how important items are in battles.
Cheren: VAR(256, 0), will you have a battle with me? I want to test how important items are in battles.
Really? I really want to try out my items, so I'll just wait here until you decide you're ready.
Cheren: Well, let's see how effective my items are... Or maybe I should test how well I can battle without items...? Anyway, this is an indoor match, so let's battle without getting too rough!
Cheren: So learning to use items well is definitely important, then. Oh, here. VAR(256, 0), I'll give you these Berries.
Cheren: If you give a Pokémon this kind of Berry to hold, it will eat it to heal up when its HP goes down in battle. But if you give Pokémon man-made items like Potions to hold, they can't use them. Well, good luck, then.
This Trainers' School exists to meet the demands of Trainers who want to know more about Pokémon because they love them!
Pokémon have mysterious powers called Abilities. Abilities have a variety of effects, and many of those effects are activated when Pokémon are in battle!
There is a technique that lets you cancel evolution! I'll read the book about it to you. Are you ready? “You can surprise a Pokémon and stop its evolution by pressing the B Button when a Pokémon is evolving."
Some moves can only be taught with TMs. TMs can be used over and over, so you might want to use them a lot. If you don't like the move you taught, you can always use a different TM.
Would you like to take a quiz about status conditions?
So here is the question: Which of the following items cures poison?
Antidote
Parlyz Heal
Awakening
Ding ding ding! Right answer! Now for the next question.
The item that cures paralysis is Parlyz Heal, but... Which of the following items wakes up a sleeping Pokémon?
Ding ding ding! We have a winner! Fantastic answer! Since you know so much about status conditions, I'll give you this!
Full Heal does exactly what the name suggests--it heals all status conditions!
Come talk to me if you want to take a quiz.
Buzzzzz! Too bad... That's incorrect. Please try again sometime!
The blackboard explains Pokémon status changes in battle.
What do you want to read about?
If poisoned, a Pokémon steadily loses HP when battling. The poison lingers after the battle. To cure it, use an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat and may prevent movement. It remains after battle, so use a Parlyz Heal.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to attack. The Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if a battle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep. Wake it up using an Awakening.
A burn reduces the Attack stat and steadily reduces the victim's HP. A burn lingers after battle. Cure a burn using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely helpless. The Pokémon may thaw out on its own, but if a battle ends while it is frozen, it will stay frozen. Thaw it out using an Ice Heal.
Poison
Paralysis
Sleep
Burn
Frozen
Cancel

Cheren: Come with me a sec.
If you go straight from here, there's a Pokémon Center. And... Use these if you want.
Cheren: Give your Pokémon a Chesto Berry to hold. Then, if it ever falls asleep, it will wake up immediately. Oh, and another piece of advice-- Nacrene City's Gym Leader uses Normal types. If you have a Fighting-type Pokémon, it might give you a big advantage.
N: VAR(48649, 1)I...want to see things no one can see. The ideals of Pokémon inside Poké Balls. The truths of how Trainers should be. And a future where Pokémon have become perfect... Do you feel the same?VAR(48649, 0)

Lenora: This is a surprise visit! Are you suffering from artist's block again?
VAR(256, 0)! This is Burgh. He may not look like it, but he's Castelia City's Gym Leader!
Burgh: ...Eh? Just looking for a change of pace. Seems hectic or something around here. What's up?
Lenora: What's up?! Someone just walked away with an exhibit, that's what's up!
Bianca: Oh, hi, VAR(256, 0)! What's everybody doing here?
Cheren: VAR(256, 0), is there some kind of problem?
Lenora: And these two are...? Your friends? ... ... Bianca and Cheren... Oh, I see. They're Trainers. OK, then. Let's split up and search. I'll head this way.
Everyone! Cheren and Bianca, I want you to stay here at the museum.
Burgh and VAR(256, 0), you two search Pinwheel Forest! Got it? Burgh, you show the way! I'm counting on you, everyone!
Burgh: Uh-huh. You are...VAR(256, 0), is it? Are you raring to round up our robbers?
Burgh: Uh-huh. You are...VAR(256, 0), is it? Are you raring to round up our robbers?
Bianca: Oh! Oh, VAR(256, 0)! Take this with you! Fennel gave me this Dowsing Machine to give you.
Now, what did she tell me? Um... You can use the Dowsing Machine to find places where items are hidden. So you can find stuff you can't even see!
Cheren: For now, all we need to do is protect the museum, right?
Bianca: Hey, wait for me!
Lenora: It doesn't look like there are any members of Team Plasma over here... I think I'd better stay here, though. Please head to Pinwheel Forest and search very carefully!
These old textile factories and storehouses were abandoned. But enterprising young people started using them as studios. That could be called the beginning of Nacrene City, the city of art.
That warehouse... They're selling something good inside.
Even though it's just an old warehouse, it's become so popular... It makes me take a second look at what I think things are worth.
Nacrene City is a highly fashionable and admired locale! Contrariwise, if you happen to be a bit ordinary, here that's cool in its own way.
How do you like the sound of accordions?

Professor Juniper: Alder told me what's going on. VAR(256, 0), you got caught up in something serious, it seems...
Lenora: Is this it?
Bianca: Whoa. Isn't that the...stone... found in the Desert Resort?
Lenora: Yes, that's right, but is this really a Dragon-type Pokémon?
Cedric: Surely... When I investigated Dragonspiral Tower, I found elements that were dated to the same era as this Dark Stone!
Cedric: Surely... When I investigated Dragonspiral Tower, I found elements that were dated to the same era as this Light Stone!
Professor Juniper: ...I looked into that.
Lenora: Impressive, as always.
Bianca: But, you know, we're lucky... 'Cause what if Team Plasma, like, noticed that old stone that time...
Lenora: That's a good point. It's clear to me that they were trying to steal the Dragon Skull so they could revive the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon.
If you would, VAR(256, 0), take this...
Alder: Wait a moment, VAR(256, 0)!
If you take this Dark Stone, that means you'll be the one to battle N if anything happens to me. Are you really OK with that?
If you take this Light Stone, that means you'll be the one to battle N if anything happens to me. Are you really OK with that?
Alder: I understand. You are determined to take on this duty. Then, here it is. Prepare yourself. Be strong.
Alder: So, you're just going to allow N to fulfill his plans for a new world? A world where Pokémon and Trainers are separated?
Alder: Still, I must ask you... Sincerely, I must ask you... Take this stone. Just in case it's needed!
Alder: I am deeply sorry. I wish I didn't have to burden you. This world of ours, where Pokémon and people live together... Please... If anything happens to me, protect it!
Lenora: ...I see. If things don't go as planned, you'll use this Dark Stone. You'll protect the ideal future for us and Pokémon. VAR(256, 0), we're counting on you. Please take care of yourself.
Lenora: ...I see. If things don't go as planned, you'll use this Light Stone. You'll protect the true future for us and Pokémon. VAR(256, 0), we're counting on you. Please take care of yourself.

Huh?
...
Umm...
Lenora: That's it! We've got them, don't we?
Alder: Ah-hah. We've got those two.
VAR(256, 0)! Go to Opelucid City. The Gym Leader of that city uses Dragon-type Pokémon. The Gym Leader could know something. I'll go ahead and wait for you there! Until then!
Professor Juniper: That's right! Opelucid City's Iris might know something!
Professor Juniper: That's right! Opelucid City's Drayden might know something!
Cedric: Hey, VAR(256, 0). Never forget that you always have Pokémon right by your side.
Professor Juniper: I'm going to head back to the lab and do some research... I'll see if I can uncover what kinds of beings these legendary Dragon-type Pokémon are and if there is any way to awaken them...
Lenora: Don't worry! If we have something for you, we'll come running to find you!
Lenora: Don't worry! If we have something for you, we'll come running to find you!
Bianca: Ooh. Sounds real serious... Um, that's about all I got out of it. VAR(256, 0), do you know Opelucid City? When you leave from Icirrus City and, like, cross the Tubeline Bridge, it's on the other side. Umm... I'm not that great with directions, so if you need more, check your Town Map, OK?

Welcome to the Nacrene Museum!
Those robbers... What in the world is Team Plasma?
You can get to the Pokémon Gym by going to the back of the museum!
What do they plan to accomplish by stealing the Dragon Skull?
Wow! Whenever I look at this skeleton, I'm...fascinated.
Welcome! I'm Hawes, the assistant director. Since you were kind enough to visit, I'll give you a tour of the museum.
This skeleton is of a Dragon-type Pokémon. There's a theory that it had an accident while it was flying around the world, and so it became a Fossil.
This rock is amazing! It's a meteorite! It contains some kind of energy from space.
Oh, this? It's an ordinary old stone. It was found near the desert, but other than the fact that it's old, it doesn't seem to have any value... We only display it because it's rather pretty to look at.
The Pokémon Gym is just beyond here.
At the end of the Gym, a very strong and kind Gym Leader is waiting. By the way, the Gym Leader Lenora happens to be my wife!
At the end of the Gym, a very strong and kind Gym Leader is waiting. By the way, the Gym Leader Lenora happens to be my wife!
Lenora: Now, you wait! Enough fooling around!
Team Plasma: So you've come, Gym Leader. We, Team Plasma, claim this museum's Dragon Skull in the name of Pokémon liberation!
Team Plasma: To show you we're serious, we'll steal it right before your eyes!
Team Plasma: Well, then, here's our smoke screen!
Plasmaaaa!
Plasmaaaa!
Lenora: What's going on?
Hawes: Oh! Oh! We have to go after them!
Hawes: Lenora loves that skull...
Bianca: I won't forgive those thieves!
Cheren: So I can't battle the Gym Leader because of Team Plasma, huh... What a bother.
Skeletal specimens are so mysterious... From the outside, you can't see their functional, efficient design. It's almost as if it is an embodiment of their former essence... So fascinating!
Rare Pokémon from around the world... Museums are packed with adventure!
My oh my oh my!
The Gym Leader here studies Fossils and ancient artifacts.
Those thugs sure were bold... It's almost as if they believe they are doing the right thing.
Perhaps there is a Pokémon that came from space along with this meteorite.
What in the world could Team Plasma be thinking?!
This is a skeletal specimen from a Pokémon that flew around the world.
Part of the skeleton was stolen by Team Plasma and is missing!
It's a Fossil of a Pokémon that was protected by a very hard shell.
A meteor that has a space virus attached to it.
An ancient round stone that was buried in the desert.
A plate with an unknown script carved into it.
A mask that ancient people used to wear at festivals.
Bones that were once carried as weapons by a certain kind of Pokémon.

All Trainers in this Gym use Normal-type Pokémon. This is just between you and me... Normal-type Pokémon are weak against Fighting-type Pokémon. Around here, Fighting-type Pokémon show up around Pinwheel Forest. Now, I will explain about the Gym itself! In this Pokémon Gym, if you answer questions hidden in books, you can move forward. For your information, the first book is “Nice to Meet You, Pokémon." If you don't know where the book is, please ask anyone!

Oh? Are you looking for a book? ...I think “Nice to Meet You, Pokémon" is on a shelf near the entrance.
Hello, Trainer! You've found a memo already, and you're looking for a book about Pokémon? Tee hee! In fact, I am also reading a book about Pokémon. It's about Tepig. I wonder if the first Pokémon you met in this Gym was Tepig?
Tee hee! What a pity! The first Pokémon you met in this Gym was not Tepig! Try to remember the Pokémon you battled at the entrance of the Gym. There's a hint on the bookshelf to the left!
Tee hee! OK! What was the Pokémon you battled at the entrance of the Gym? There's a hint on the bookshelf to the left!
What was the first Pokémon you met in this Gym? There's a hint on the bookshelf to the left!
You found the second memo, and you're looking for a book? ...What does the memo say? “Flame burns inside its body, and it gives off smoke from its head while it runs." I'm reading a book about Tepig, but is this book the correct answer?
Tee hee! What a pity! This book about Tepig says: “It gives off flame from its nostrils. When it's not well, it can give off only smoke." That's slightly different from “it gives off smoke from its head while it runs." ...The answer to this memo may not be a living thing. Tee hee!
Wow! Great! That's correct! The book that I am reading says: “It gives off flame from its nostrils. When it's not well, it can give off only smoke." It's slightly different from “it gives off smoke from its head while it runs." ...The answer to this memo may not be a living thing. Tee hee!
“Flame burns inside its body, and it gives off smoke from its head while it runs." Did you figure it out? ...The answer to this memo may not be a living thing! Tee hee!
Have you already found the third memo? Pretty good! ...So, what does the memo say? “If you heat it up in a pot, it'll be delicious. What is this?" The book I am reading is about Tepig... But you don't think this book about Tepig is the answer, do you?!
Oh, I know you're just kidding! ...It reminds me. In the past, I've seen sweets made by heating up Berries. Now, what were they called?
Of course you don't! ...It reminds me. In the past, I've seen sweets made by heating up Berries. Now, what were they called?
In the past, I've seen sweets made by heating up Berries. Now, what were they called?
...I'm wondering, did you see the last memo and come to me? OK. I'll give you the last question! “Can you challenge the Gym Leader if you win against me?"
Tee hee! That is correct! Well, here we go, Trainer!
Hmmmmm... What a pity! I will tell you the answer if you win against me!
You'll meet the Gym Leader soon. This is the last book. Now! Read the last book!
You'll meet the Gym Leader soon. This is the last book!

Oh! That is correct! “Flame burns inside its body, and it gives off smoke from its head while it runs." That's exactly how a locomotive looks! Well, I'll let you read this book. But, before that... It would be great for my research if we had a Pokémon battle.

It describes the best timing to switch Pokémon in battle. You should switch out your Pokémon before you think it's in danger!
It describes how a Pokémon Center works. It also describes a typical day of a woman who works there.
It describes the biology of Patrat. They communicate with each other by movement of their tails. A Patrat raises its tail when it sees an enemy.
It describes the biology of Snivy. If they expose their tails to the sun by basking in a sunny place, they are in the middle of photosynthesis.
It describes the biology of Oshawott. The scalchop on its belly is very hard and grows from its bellybutton. Oshawott use it as a tool.

There is a memo between the pages... “Pokémon Trainers! I am the Gym Leader, Lenora! I hid four memos in this library.  Each of them has a question. Can you solve the questions and  come find me?

Welcome! The director of the Nacrene Museum and the Nacrene Gym's Leader is me! Lenora! Well then, challenger, I'm going to research how you battle with the Pokémon you've so lovingly raised!
Your fighting style is so enchanting. It is charming. You are a Pokémon Trainer worthy of receiving this Basic Badge!
VAR(256, 0) received the Basic Badge from Lenora!
If you have two Badges, traded Pokémon up to Lv. 30 will obey you. Here, I also want you to have this TM.
Retaliate does a lot more damage if an ally fainted the turn before you use it! If you master the timing, you can defeat even strong opponents.
Some problems you can't solve even if you think about them your whole life. Some problems have different answers depending on the person. Still, the reason I can't keep my curiosity down is this: I want to figure out the truth, but I also have a desire for adventure!

I heard that the Fossils in the museum were found in Twist Mountain. Then, a person called Clay apparently donated them to the museum.

Yay! Please take good care of my VAR(257, 1)! I will take good care of your VAR(257, 0)!

The VAR(258, 0) that I got from you has grown up and become very strong! Let's have a battle!
Yay! I'll show off how I trained this Pokémon!
I want to show you how VAR(258, 0) has grown up...
I had a great time! I traded my Pokémon with yours, and on top of that, we had a great battle. I'm so happy to be with Pokémon!

It's very friendly toward you! It must be happy with you.
It's a little bit friendly to you... Something like that.
Hmmm... It may still take some time.

Pokémon you get through trades grow up fast. But be careful! If a traded Pokémon grows up too much, it won't listen to you. But if you have a lot of Badges, you'll be OK.

The Striaton City Gym Leaders are a great triplet combo! The Grass-type Pokémon user, Cilan, chooses great tea leaves. The Water-type Pokémon user, Cress, prepares the best water. And the Fire-type Pokémon user, Chili, pours hot water at the right heat. No wonder their tea is the best!
When you battle with a friend using wireless communications, you can use items using a Wonder Launcher!
Yes, I know! If you have a Wonder Launcher, energy will be charged, and you can use various items.

Hello, Trainer! I think Potions are important for a trip!
I should have bought more Poké Balls! A Pokémon I wanted to catch just came out, and I missed it!
Hi! I have some questions for you! If you want to play, which do you prefer: outside or at home?
I see, I see! Then, which one are you interested in: the thing everybody knows or the thing nobody knows?
Oh, really?
In my view, you are a person with common sense!
I'd say you are quite active!
I'd say you are very curious!
I'd say you are quite composed!
I'd say you are quite relaxed!
Outside
At home
Neither
The thing everybody knows
The thing nobody knows

Burgh: That way! M'hm. There, heading toward the Gym?!


When work's finally over... When my thrown Poké Ball rocks three times and I hear that great “click"... My life is full of things that give me joy!
I'm a battling Clerk ⑭! ...But my Pokémon are weak.
Busy, busy! After I eat breakfast, I have to think about lunch. After eating lunch, I worry about dinner. Every day's the same. What a busy life!
Hey there, Trainer! Are your Pokémon healthy? Being healthy's the best, because when you're healthy, you can do anything!
...Grumble, grumble, grumble. Should I change my Pokémon's moves, or should I change my Pokémon? Grumble, grumble...
Castelia City has so many people! Sometimes there are people who are only interested in themselves.
My favorite way to spend my lunch break is watching ships at the dock.
Working women are beautiful, and battling Pokémon are wonderful!
At the Battle Company, we welcome Trainers who are proud of their skills.
Next time, I'll do it! Next time, I want to eat a Casteliacone for sure!

Thanks again for your help. My bug Pokémon are scurrying with excitement about getting to battle you. Let's get straight to it!
Aww... I lost. Whatever! Losing to you doesn't bug me because you are a-MAZ-ingly strong! This is the Gym Badge! You beat me, so it's yours!
VAR(256, 0) received the Insect Badge from Burgh.
It's the Insect Badge! It's insectible--I mean, incredible! If you have three Badges, Pokémon up to Lv. 40 will obey you, including traded Pokémon. Because I'm a generous guy, I'll also give you this.
Struggle Bug also lowers the Sp. Atk of the target that was damaged. I'm the best guy to tell you, it's the little things that count!
How many discoveries have you made since you started your adventure? When I was a kid, my innocent heart was captured by the beauty of bug Pokémon. I drew with them and battled with them, and after all this time, I continue to discover new things. A world shared with Pokémon is a world swarming with mysteries.
Burgh: Heya! This is what I do. I keep raising Pokémon and drawing pictures inspired by the Pokémon I raise. It's what I love to do. My life hums with energy. What could be better?
When you step on the switch, the one that pops out is--moi! On that note, have a battle with moi!
Hiding makes battle instincts dull, you know.
Now. Come. On. Step on this switch, and what happens? Moi!
Yeeeeeeeeah! Thank you for going to the trouble of calling me out! I'll channel my gratitude into my Pokémon's moves and... make sure it gets to you!
If you hadn't stepped on that switch, I'd still be stuck hidden away. That's right! Bug Gym Trainers like to be bugged!
Hiding beneath the floor, I understand how a Bug-type Pokémon feels.
What do you think of Castelia City? I bet, with all of the bustling people, you started feeling worn down on your way to the Gym! Never mind! This will help. Take it!
The theme of this Gym is walking through walls. At first glance, these funny honey walls may look impassable or even impossible. If you try hard, it'll work out. So I say. But...if it doesn't, here's a sweet tip: step on the switches on the floor!
Wow! That's amazing! You swatted aside our Gym Leader Burgh's tricky attacks... I can barely imagine how much stronger you're going to get!
The Gym Leader said he was going to Prime Pier and left for a little bit. You're welcome to go track him down.

Burgh: That way! M'hm. Toward the Gym?!
Hey, Trainer! Show me your paces! Give me a whirl!
All riiight! A fight is like a dance!
Come on, man! You gotta go with the flow!
Hey hey, Trainer! Show me what you can do! Take me on for a second!
All riiight! Let's get down!
How 'bout that! Those were some smooth moves, no doubt! But it'd be even tighter if I had a group.
Hey, you! Would you talk to the other Dancers? If you invite both of them, the three of us can groove as a team!
Same outfit as me! That guy's a Dancer!
The word on the street is... Who's that dancin' in a lonely street? Who's that dancin' in a port? Who can you meet? Word on the street!
Thanks for talking to him! We're checkin' out our moves!
Really? I'd sure show you some sweet moves if I had a team, though.
I've got what I needed to find my dance! A team! Fantastic!
Dancers dance! The audience smiles! Hearts beat with joy! Enough happiness to share!
Thanks, man! I've got the best team in the world here! That's how I feel.
We communicate by dancing. It's how we say happy things, sad things... How we say the world shines brightly!
All riiight! Let's dance!
Landscapes with people... Landscapes with Pokémon... Each has power and beauty, compelling me to draw them both. Oh, my studio is down Mode Street a bit.

Cheren: Hey, VAR(256, 0). I just challenged the Gym Leader Burgh.
He's a seasoned Gym Leader. He made me work for that Gym Badge! But for me, Bug-type Pokémon aren't much of a challenge.
I'm going to keep winning like this against all of the Unova region's Gym Leaders! Then, I'll head for the Pokémon League and outperform the Champion! If I do that, everyone will admit what a strong Trainer I am... That will make me feel truly alive...
Burgh: Ah hah! You're the one who fought Team Plasma in Pinwheel Forest... If I remember, your name is... VAR(256, 0)! Come to challenge the Gym, I suppose?
Burgh: Ah hah! You're the one who fought Team Plasma in Pinwheel Forest... If I remember, your name is... VAR(256, 0)! Come to challenge the Gym, I suppose?
Aww. Sorry, but could you wait a bit? I was informed that Team Plasma has shown up! In fact... Come with me! I'm going to the dock at Prime Pier!
Burgh: This is definitely the place.
Team Plasma: No one's here! Not a soul! No other Team Plasma members, nor any of the Seven Sages, are inside. ...If you think I'm lying, why don't we have a little battle and find out?
Team Plasma: Don't scare me like that. Come on!
Team Plasma: I...had a thought! I'll take care of this weak-looking runt, so you can show off by handling that tough-looking guy over there!
Think about how a Pokémon feels when it's being used by a pathetic Trainer!
What's your problem with taking people's Pokémon?!
Burgh: Oh, please! VAR(256, 0), I'll leave that one to you!
Burgh: Oh, please! VAR(256, 0), I'll leave that one to you!
Burgh: Looks like our only option is to battle them and go on in.
Team Plasma: This is bad... Badbadbadbadbadbadbad! Bad for Team Plasma! Or Plasbad, for short! It's in my best interest to go report to the Seven Sages right now!
Iris: Phew, we got lost. Even with directions from the Xtransceiver, I couldn't figure it out!
Burgh: Team Plasma is inside. The stolen Pokémon may be in there as well. OK, I'm going in!
Iris: OK! This time, I'll join the fight! Come on, Bianca. You, too!
Bianca: W-wait! VAR(256, 0)! You come, too!
The Xtransceiver is ringing.
VAR(256, 0) picked up the Xtransceiver.
What Gym Leaders test is the strength of the bond between the challenger and his or her Pokémon!
Before challenging the Gym, you'll want to be sure you have enough Potions.
Being a Pokémon Trainer doesn't necessarily make someone stronger. But everyone can love their Pokémon and enjoy playing together.
I have six Poké Balls in my Bag! But, really, what I want is Great Balls and Ultra Balls! You can't buy them at the Poké Mart until you've collected Badges, though.
My Pokémon is soooo cute! It always makes me feel better when I come home!

Meow! How did you find me?! You are something else! So, I'm going to give you something. This!
If you use the move Flash, the accuracy of the opponent's moves goes down. When you use it twice, the rate to get hit by a move will be about half. 'Cause it means more light!

The Royal Unova leaves once a day, only in the evening. It is a cruiser-type passenger ship.
The Royal Unova operates only in the evening. Please come back again.
I'm sorry, you don't have enough money. Please come back again.
The ticket is $1,000. Would you like to get on board?

From the deck of the world-famous Royal Unova, you can enjoy a spectacular view. And the passenger cabins are full of Trainers who love to battle. Please enjoy both the view and the battles! Note that as C-Gears may affect radio signals or instruments in the ship, we ask that you refrain from using them. Thank you.
The power of the C-Gear will be turned off. Is that OK?
We are leaving the port shortly. Bon voyage!
Certainly. Please come back again.
Thank you for sailing with us on the Royal Unova. Have a nice day!
We are closed for the day. Please come again tomorrow.

Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour are Pokémon that evolve with special stones! Which Pokémon do you want to evolve?
Pansage... Then, it's a Leaf Stone you need.
Pansear... Then, it's a Fire Stone you need.
Panpour... Then, it's a Water Stone you need.
You might already know this, but I will give you some advice! When a Pokémon evolves, it will be more powerful, but it will be slower to learn a new move. This is especially true for Pokémon that evolve with stones. So, it's up to you: you can have it learn a good move and then evolve it with a stone, or evolve it with a stone fast and then have it learn a move with a TM!

Yes, it's a good greeting! It cheers me up! Please feel free to come and say hi again! I look forward to seeing you again!
Hello! Do you always have a feeling of gratitude?
Oh, you dropped your Poké Ball. Here you are.
VAR(256, 1) received a Poké Ball.
Please remember to thank someone who helps you! It may sound trivial, but it's important. Now, will you tell me your feeling of gratitude?
If you don't mind, will you show me your feeling of gratitude again?
Thanks!
Then, maybe next time. Don't forget a feeling of gratitude!
What a wonderful phrase! It warms up my heart. If somebody helps you, show your feelings of gratitude. I am sure they will appreciate your feelings.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? If you complete several survey requests, you can advance in rank! If you advance in rank, people will look up to you, and you can get something good!
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are a B-rank statistician. You advanced to the B rank! You've been working hard. If you advance in rank, you'll get more new requests, so you might want to talk to the leader.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are an A-rank statistician. You're already in the A rank. That's awesome! I also have to work hard and take surveys. I heard requests for the A rank were difficult. Keep up the good work!
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are an S-rank statistician. You are close to the S+ rank, which is the best! I will support you! Good luck.
Do you know the ranks of statisticians? Oh, you are VAR(256, 1). You are an S+ rank statistician! Wow! I will also do my best to advance in rank as much as possible!
If you want to check your information, look at the graph on the back wall. Information about all the statisticians is kept there. Of course, we checked the information about you!
Have you answered a questionnaire? You should at least answer about what kind of person you are.
Are you having a hard time getting new survey items in the Survey Radar? If you want more survey items, answer questionnaires in the headquarters.
If you are an S-rank statistician, you must have answered all the questionnaires. What you want to know is what everybody wants to know. Please volunteer to answer questionnaires.
Good work today, VAR(256, 1)! We have more statisticians, and this place has become quite lively. The way things are going, we can collect more survey data.
The more I conduct surveys, the more fun it will be. I'm determined to pass by more people! It's way more fun to conduct surveys with people than doing them by myself.
By any chance, are you having trouble? If it's difficult to pass by many people, I recommend you try a timed survey. It takes time, but if you pass by just one person, you can complete the request.
I'll give you a hint. If you go to a place full of people, I recommend a head-count survey. You can collect survey data really fast, so you can complete the request in a short time.
Good work today, VAR(256, 1)! You've become the top statistician instantly. I should learn a lot from you and work hard!
When I answered a questionnaire earlier, I got a questionnaire sheet. Maybe I will answer all the questionnaires...
After the questionnaire, the next step is conducting a survey. Set the request you want to survey on the Survey Radar... And let's go!
New statisticians are not answering questionnaires. If they answered questionnaires, they could conduct more surveys... What a shame!
Hello, VAR(256, 1)! I've also started teaching novice statisticians how to conduct surveys.
What is the popular movie now? VAR(256, 1), do you have any idea?
What is the popular food now? VAR(256, 1), do you have any idea?
What is the popular... Oh, VAR(256, 1). I knew it. I have to take a survey by myself... Ah, it is a pain in the neck...
The survey requests from the leader are hard. Don't you agree? Besides, the number of more difficult surveys are increasing...
Hello! Good work today, VAR(256, 1). Have you finished all the survey requests from the leader? I heard if you finish all the requests, you can get something good!
Oh! VAR(256, 1)! I'm honored to see you! Oh, wow! VAR(256, 1) spoke to me!
STATISTICIANS WANTED! FOR DETAILS, ASK THE LEADER!
VAR(256, 0) Statistician rank: C rank Number of times thanked: VAR(516, 2) Number of people passed by: VAR(516, 1)

Currently, we exhibit works in the motif of legends in the Unova region.
If you want to see Burgh's paintings, go to the Pokémon Gym!
Title “Ideals and Truth"
Title “Soaring White Dragon"
Title “White Flame"
Title “Alighting Black Dragon"
Title “Black Lightning Bolt"
Title “Twin Heroes"
I am not as good an artist as Burgh, but I have a liking for paintings. Let me see. Today, I'd like to paint VAR(259, 0)-type Pokémon! Will you show me what kinds of Pokémon you have?
Please show me a Pokémon that's VAR(259, 0) type!
Oh! You have that type! I'm inspired! Thank you! As a token of my gratitude, which one would you like?
Cheri Berry
Chesto Berry
Pecha Berry
Rawst Berry
Aspear Berry
One VAR(265, 0)! It's all yours now!
Aww. You are the best! Please come back tomorrow, too!
As long as the artist enjoys creating an artwork, it doesn't matter if the result is judged as bad or good.
If you catch a Pokémon that's VAR(259, 0) type, please show it to me! I'll give you a little something.
The Pokémon you chose is not the one I requested. What I want to paint is a Pokémon that's VAR(259, 0) type!
Oh! The shape of this Egg... Superb! It gives me chills! It's electrifying! It makes me tremble! Alas, even I cannot tell what type an Egg is!

People who work in this building have Pokémon battles, not opinion battles. You appear to be strong, but if you go upstairs, please be extra careful.

Welcome! If you use the elevator, please use the buttons on the door or next to the door.
Every morning, my Pokémon wakes me with Wake-Up Slap, so I always look like a wreck. But I appreciate its good intentions, so I'll work my hardest to provide for it today, as always.
This is Battle Company. Research and Development of Items!
Burgh's signature is scrawled in the corner of the painting.

===============================
Text File: 50
===============================
I am in charge of development! I'm going to give you this, because you came here for a company tour!
If a Pokémon holds a Scope Lens, it has a better chance to make a critical hit!
Oh! A company tour? Or some Pokémon practice? Either way, I'm glad you came. I'm happy, so I'll give you these!
I'm very happy, so I will give you another present!
A Quick Ball makes it easier to catch a Pokémon if you use it at the very beginning of a battle. And a Timer Ball makes it easier to catch a Pokémon you've been battling for a long time!

Oh! You are the Pokémon Trainer I met at the entrance! You've come this far. That means you must be quite strong. Are you prepared to face the strongest person in this building? Are you prepared to face the chairman? Then, the time has come. I am the one! I accept your challenge!
I disguise myself as a janitor because I like to know what kinds of Trainers come here. I had a good time battling you. This is a token of my esteem. Please accept this!
A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share gets some of the Exp. Points from every battle, even if it's not involved. That's right! It may be useful for raising weak Pokémon.

'Cause he is alone and looks lonely, I was reading a book to him! I will read it to you, too!
Here, I'll keep reading! ... Zorua, who was left alone, wandered around looking for its mother...
Have you seen Zorua? See, it's the Pokémon that looks like this!
They say Zorua has the power to bewitch people! It would be scary if I were bewitched, but I like Zorua! 'Cause it's cute! ...Huh? Why are you blushing?
Castelia City is so big that I feel dizzy. Even I can get lost!
This little boy got lost! He looks lonely, so please talk to him!

Will you add Zorua to your party?
Zorua joined your party!

Zorua had been waiting for Celebi here! Now, I am relieved!
It looks like Zorua and Celebi are really good friends! I'm sure Zorua wants to go with you and Celebi! ...But do you have room for Zorua in your party? You can't take more than six Pokémon with you. Right?

Hi there! I am the Game Director. Oh! You are working on your Pokédex! If you fill it up a lot, please let me see!
Hi there! I am the Game Director. Oh! You've caught every kind of Pokémon in Unova! Wow! Excellent! We'll give you an award!!
I will send this award certificate to your house!
Hi there! I am the Game Director. Oh! Excellent! You've finally collected all the Pokémon and completed your Pokédex! To honor the efforts you have made in completing this Pokédex... Allow me to present you with this award!
How did you meet all the Pokémon to fill up your Pokédex? Did you work long and hard to catch and raise them? Did you receive them as gifts from friends? Maybe you got some in trades from around the world? Though everyone's Pokédex may look the same, the stories they contain are all unique!
I will send this award certificate to your house, too!
Beware of spoilers! What I'm working on is the ending of the game. Don't look at it here! You'll have to play it for yourself.
I am the Graphic Designer. I am devoting all my energy to every dot! Hup! I should put one dot here as if I'm making this part hollow!
A tip for getting strong in Pokémon battles... Let me see. I guess the most important thing is... having a lot of battles! If you become very strong, come back and have a Pokémon battle with me!
Oh! You've become strong! I can tell. Do you want to have a battle with me?
Well, let's begin!
You think about battles very thoroughly. I lost, but I learned a lot from you. Besides, it was fun! Come back again tomorrow.
No? I've been raising Pokémon, thinking about their Abilities and just the right combination of held items. What a pity... 
I'm Snorlax. No, no. I'm the Planner! I don't mean to butt in, but the Leftovers item is important, isn't it?
I am the Sound Designer! I put in a lot of wonderful mechanisms to change the game's music! How many of them have you noticed?
I can tell you take the sound seriously, so here's a treat for you! What do you think about this dramatic sound?
Were you surprised? Well, for a strong Trainer like you, winning against Team Rocket would be a piece of cake!

The person who can make your day exceptionally happy... It's VAR(256, 0)!
Oh, you don't have to hesitate. I will read it for free!
The person who can make your day exceptionally happy is... Oh dear. You've taken a Feeling Check only with VAR(256, 0). I suggest that you take Feeling Checks with a lot of people!
You can't change the name of a Pokémon you got from someone. Because the name contains wishes of the person who named it!

By taking a Feeling Check, you can get a Sweet Heart. That's a good item, right?

My name is Mr. Lock. I'm a magical clown who can open anything. Your name is VAR(256, 0). I'll see you again, I'm sure.
You have a Lock Capsule in your Bag... I am the only one in the whole world who can open the capsule. I can open it in the blink of an eye!
Look! As you can see, I opened it swiftly and with precision! Inside the capsule... What your heart most desires... a Technical Machine!
Hm. There's a letter with the Technical Machine...
“I entrust the Technical Machine in the Lock Capsule to a trustworthy Trainer in the Unova region. Don't allow it to fall into the hands of villains like Team Rocket..."
More is written here... “TM95 is Snarl. It's a Dark-type Special Attack, and it lowers the opponents' Sp. Atk stat." So that's what it is...a move that tests the sense of the user!
Even though I opened the Lock Capsule, I can't unlock a closed heart. I am a sad clown, indeed...
I secretly invented a special machine. Only people who know the secret password can use it.
There's more!
This is the password that will enable you to use the Relocator I invented! It's a superb machine that will swiftly fetch a special Pokémon or item by connecting to a special network.
I added a button on the main menu. Please save the game, then go back to the title screen!
Unfortunately, it seems that you don't remember the password...
Did you find my Relocator useful?

But, before that...
They said we can have a Pokémon battle in the gate as long as we're careful not to break the electric bulletin board. I'm the new-and-improved version of me! It's gonna go great this time! Let's start up our Pokémon battle again!
Bianca: I'll never be a strong Trainer like you or Cheren or Iris, but... You know, since we left Nuvema Town, I've met a lot of people and I've been thinking about what I want to do in life! When you look at it that way, Pokémon have given me a lot of new experiences.
Having my Pokémon stolen was just really hard, and I felt really unsure... Still, I gotta say I'm really glad I went! I've learned so much on this journey. And I also learned that being with Pokémon is really, really important! OK, well, I hope to see you again soon! Bye-bye, VAR(256, 0)!
Maybe I should try to find a Pokémon on Route 4 to catch!
Route 4 is long! Be careful if you plan to follow it!
Nimbasa City is at the end of Route 4.

The number of Trainers on the Royal Unova today is VAR(512, 3). And you've won against VAR(512, 4). The ship is nearing the port. Would you like to get off the ship?
The number of Trainers on the Royal Unova today is VAR(512, 3). The ship is nearing the port. Would you like to get off the ship?
There are a lot of cabins in this big ship! I would like to give you advice 'cause you need help finding Trainers! Do you want to listen to my hint?
Some guests like to tell really long stories, and they just keep talking until they hear a whistle!
The Royal Unova's renowned observation deck is just ahead.
If you’re looking in the cabins with blue doors for someone to battle, you’ll find only one Trainer there today.
It seems the number of Trainers in the cabins with blue doors today is VAR(512, 2).
It's running on the ocean! What a peculiar thing to see!
I can't make up my mind whether to go to the observation deck or battle some Trainers in the cabins.
I'm running with the rhythm of the waves, but it's a real challenge!
Having battles on the ship and seeing the scenery from the deck... This ship is the best!
I'm still wondering which cabin to enter.
I came here from Johto for business, but everything is dynamic here.
Are you from Unova? I came here from Johto for business. As I thought, a foreign region is so different! What's the difference? ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... so, ... ... ... ... ... Well, ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Don't you agree?
Oh! A whistle is blowing! Sorry to keep you so long... But it was fun to talk with you. Thank you!
A battle break from work! It is particularly fun.
I had a great battle on my break from work.
There are yet more Pokémon across the water! The excitement never stops!
I am having a relaxing time in this opulent cabin.
I heard that strong Trainers gather here, so I came all the way from Sinnoh! Let me enjoy some Pokémon battles!
I can have Pokémon battles while I'm being rocked in the ship. Plus, I can see Pokémon that are rarely seen. I am soooo happy!
I heard a lot of Trainers in this ship are from the other side of the ocean. Speaking of which, I am also from Kanto!
Did you go to the observation deck? You can see an incredible view!
Having Pokémon battles while on the ship, being rocked by the ocean waves... Isn't it exciting?
I lost... Maybe I will go check out the view...
Cool! Cool! What is cool? This ship! This ship! ...Which part is cool? Hmmmm... It's just cool!
A Pokémon battle! I thought about it, but... I don't have any Pokémon with me!
OK, Trainer! I will give you a practical demonstration that I am not just some kid who wears shorts!
Argh! I lost! I take off my socks to you!
Listen! Listen! I love this ship 'cause I can bring my Pokémon on board!
Hey! Will you listen to my story? The other day, I went to Nimbasa City! ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I know, right? Then, ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... That's what I heard, anyway!
Oh! A whistle! I apologize for making you listen to my long story... But it was fun talking to you. Thanks!
I am a Trainer. I came from a faraway region. I will show you my rarely seen Pokémon!
My Pokémon! Weren't they unusual? In particular, Wormadam is my favorite!
This gorgeous ship suits a rich person like me très bien. Am I right?
They blow a whistle five times! Even if I pretend I don't hear it, when they blow five times, it's the end...
I will show you a graceful battle on this elegant ship!
Even if I lose the battle, I will not lose my grace. That's how a Rich Boy behaves.
Oh, their room service? I tried the specialty, Royal Unova tea. It tasted wonderful!
The beautiful scenery outside the window is perfection, but I also like the royal atmosphere inside the cabin.
With a few waltz steps, I will choreograph a royal Pokémon battle!
I am enraptured with the royal Pokémon battle...
From your standpoint, I am a Trainer from beyond the sea, and from my standpoint, you are a Trainer from beyond the sea!
Oh, what a cute guest! Would you like a cup of tea? Come! Sit there and listen to my story! ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... but it ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..., you see!
Sorry, sorry. I talked too much. It was fun, though. Thank you!
Heh heh. A Pokémon battle? I got tired of relaxing in my cabin. Well, let's dance, Trainer!
You see two or three moves ahead. Sure enough, I can't win against youth!
Are you looking for Pokémon Trainers? Sorry, I don't know where to find them. But the crew may know where they are.
Oh, look at you! What a cute guest! I could talk to you for ages. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... exactly. Then, ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... That's how it is!
Oh, my! The sound of a whistle! I am so sorry. I rambled on too much!
Hi there! You are such a cute guest. May I have a Pokémon battle with you?
You're not only cute--you're also strong in Pokémon battles!
Oh, I can feel the sound in my stomach! The sound of that whistle is powerful!
You! Did you talk to me? You came at the right time! I have a very funny story. I wanted to tell the story to someone. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... That's the thing! Then, ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... That's how it ends.
Oops. Did I talk your ear off? Sorry, sorry. But I had a great time. Thanks!
To look for someone stronger than me, I crossed over the mountains, crossed over the sea, and came here. My Pokémon are special because they went through a lot of difficulties. Now, let's have a fair battle!
I can't believe you're stronger than me. I have traveled around the world! Now I understand... the world is ridiculously big!


Today... As for people, we have VAR(512, 0) on the port side and VAR(512, 1) on the starboard side.
Today... The number of people on the starboard side is VAR(512, 1), and...none on the port side.
Today... The number of people on the port side is VAR(512, 0), and...none on the starboard side.

Certainly. Just a moment, please.
Certainly. Please continue to have a great time!
Won against every Trainer on the ship!
Thank you very much for sailing with us on the Royal Unova. The number of Trainers aboard the Royal Unova today is VAR(512, 3). Please enjoy the trip.

A beautiful melody makes people happy. A sad melody makes people sorrowful... That's the power of melodies...
The scent you brought me reminded me of a long-ago melody from the fringes of my sepia-toned memories. It was a song my mother loved... It makes me feel so nostalgic. Would you like to hear the melody?
My mother once told me of a Pokémon that played a melody and danced so lightly that it filled people's hearts with joy. Then sorrow darkened the entire world, and the Pokémon lost the melody... Also, at that time, some red shoes were lost somewhere...
When you came through the door, I remembered the melody! And the Pokémon that had forgotten how to dance began to step lightly once more! You are the inspiration. You are a mysterious child...
Let it sing the Relic Song. Aria Forme will become Pirouette Forme, and vice versa.
VAR(258, 0) remembered the Relic Song it had forgotten!


This is your first visit to this café. Am I correct? Please...
Give this to your dear Pokémon.
You came all the way here. Enjoy...

People in the past said wise things. “A child who sleeps well grows well." Yes, if a Pokémon uses the move Rest, the Pokémon will fall asleep and recover! I already taught the move to my Pokémon, so I will give this to you!
Even if a Pokémon falls asleep, I heard there is a Berry to wake it up instantly. If a Pokémon holds that Berry and uses Rest, the Pokémon will fall asleep and recover, then wake up instantly! It's a great combination!

Ghetsis: My word, if it isn't the Gym Leader, Burgh.
Burgh: So, what would you say is the guiding principle of Team Plasma, anyway? “Take what you want from people"?
Bronius: I thought it would be amusing to prepare a hideout right in front of a Pokémon Gym, but we were detected more quickly than I imagined.
Ghetsis: Indeed... No matter. We already have an exceptional base of operations. Is everyone familiar with the legend of the founding of the Unova region?
Iris: I am! It's the white Dragon-type Pokémon, right?
Iris: I am! It's the black Dragon-type Pokémon, right?
Ghetsis: The truth is this... The white dragon appeared before a hero who sought the true way to knit together a world full of many warring people. This white Dragon-type Pokémon shared its knowledge--and bared its fangs at those who stood against it. Together, the power of this Pokémon and the hero brought unity to the hearts of everyone in the land, and that is how Unova was created.
Ghetsis: The truth is this... The black dragon appeared before a hero who sought the ideal way to knit together a world full of warring people. This black Dragon-type Pokémon shared its knowledge--and bared its fangs at those who stood against it. Together, the power of this Pokémon and the hero brought unity to the hearts of everyone in the land, and that is how Unova was created.
We shall bring back the hero and that Pokémon to Unova once again! If we can win people's hearts and minds, we can easily create the world that I--I mean, Team Plasma--desires!
Burgh: Here in Castelia, we have a lot of different kinds of people. Everyone's ways of thinking and lifestyles are very different. Honestly, there's something about what you're saying I don't quite understand.
Yes?
What is it?
Burgh: One thing we all have in common is that we all care a lot about Pokémon. Even people meeting for the first time can talk about Pokémon. Talk or battle or trade...
Remember your speech at Accumula Town? You were responsible for leading me to rethink my relationship with Pokémon. For that, I thank you. At that time, I made a promise... I swore to myself that I would dedicate myself to Pokémon even more strongly! What you guys are doing... Aren't you going to strengthen the bond between people and Pokémon even more?
Ghetsis: Myah-ha-ha-ha! You are quite hard to figure out--a little more intelligent than I'd expected. I am fond of intelligent people, you see. You'll enjoy hearing about this... From every corner of the world, I have gathered knowledgeable people for our king's benefit. You could call them the Seven Sages. Very well! We will submit to your opinion and be on our way.
That girl over there... Return her Pokémon!
Bianca: Th-thank you! Munny, I'm so glad to see you again!
Iris: Bianca! Why are you thanking them? They take people's precious Pokémon!
Bianca: It's just... I'm...I'm so happy that my Munna is safe.
Ghetsis: The friendship between Pokémon and people can be very touching. But, in order to liberate Pokémon from foolish people, we will revive the legend of Unova--and win the hearts and minds of everyone. Farewell...
Iris: What are you doing? Why are you letting them get away?!
Burgh: Gah! What do we do if anything's happened to the other stolen Pokémon?
Bianca: It's OK. Thank you, Iris! No one was hurt. More than anything, I got my darling Pokémon back again!
Iris: OK, if you're happy...
Burgh: What is everyone planning to do now?
Bianca: Oh, it would be sensational to look around Castelia City, but...
Iris: Don't worry! I'll keep on being your bodyguard!
Bianca: Iris...
Burgh: Uh-hm. That's great! Iris is a dazzling Pokémon Trainer, but maybe not at home in the big city yet. So, a little give-and-take, hm! People and Pokémon need to help each other out!
Iris: Also, thanks for looking for the Pokémon! Here, this is for you!

I am a Pokémon fanatic. I am famous in Castelia, too! Oh, look! You have a Pokédex! How many Pokémon have you found so far? ... VAR(514, 0) Pokémon! If you have 20 Pokémon or more, I'll give you something good!
I am a Pokémon fanatic. I am famous in Castelia, too! Oh, look! You have a Pokédex! Well, how many Pokémon have you found so far? ... VAR(514, 0) Pokémon! This is quite a Pokédex! I am quite impressed, so I will give this to you!
Eviolite is great! Both Defense and Special Defense of the Pokémon who holds it will increase! However, it's a peculiar stone because it's only effective on Pokémon that can still evolve.
I've been thinking about starting a new business... But it's quite a chore.
Do you think it's a good idea to provide a service to raise Pokémon for Trainers? What? There's a Pokémon Day Care on Route 3?!
What kinds of Abilities do your Pokémon have?
My Patrat's Ability is Keen Eye! Even SmokeScreen and Sand-Attack cannot lower its accuracy!
Skeeree!
Hmmm! Fantastic! Excellent! Burgh's paintings are magnificent!

I'm invited to a party, but the person in front of the elevator wants to pat me down. Or is it just my imagination?
I talked with a lot of people upstairs. It was fun!
Where are you from? Really? You're from Nuvema Town? It's a great place!

Welcome! Welcome to my party! Please enjoy conversations with everyone!
Ich habe mir nun ein Auto zugelegt! Damit ist die nächste Stadt auch ganz ohne Orden zum Greifen nah! Es sei denn, ich rassele durch meine Führerscheinprüfung...
Hello. Have you tried a Casteliacone yet? I managed to buy one on Tuesday, but it's very difficult to get!
Hey, Trainer! Check out my moves! Have you gone to the next city yet? I learned this move at the musical over there. Pretty cool, isn't it?
Ohhhh! Your Pokémon are so charming! I want cute Pokémon, too, so I can use this!
This move makes your Pokémon unbearably charming! All Pokémon of the opposite gender will fall in love!
Did you see the dress that the supermodel, Elesa, was wearing?
Whatever Elesa wears is beautiful. A stunning ensemble!
My boyfriend isn't good at getting out of bed in the morning... In fact, he's so slow getting out of bed that I asked his Pokémon to use Wake-Up Slap on him!
Ciao! Ti stai divertendo? Non sentirti in imbarazzo. Parla pure con chi vuoi.
It's hard to get up the morning after a fun day like today.
I've asked my Pokémon to use Sing instead of setting an alarm clock. But I cannot get up at all. I don't know why.
¡Es la primera vez que vengo aquí! ¡Pero este precioso paisaje hace que me sienta como en casa! ¡La próxima vez traeré a mis amigos!

Team Plasma: Gramps! We know you run the Day Care! How do we know? Because we're Team Plasma!
Team Plasma: We are taking Pokémon away from people. Since you work at the Day Care, we figure you must have a lot of Pokémon! Hand 'em over!
Day-Care Man: What kind of nonsense is this?!
Oh! A strong-looking Trainer! Please help me!
Team Plasma: If you're going to get in our way, we'll take your Pokémon, too!
Team Plasma: !!
Team Plasma: This went downhill fast! So I think... We'd better... Ruuuun! Let's hide out at the amusement park!
Day-Care Man: Thank you so much! Please take this as a token of my gratitude. It's a brand-new Bike. I'd always planned on riding around Nimbasa City... But I never ended up riding it.
Day-Care Man: I have a Day Care on Route 3! If you have any Pokémon you want me to raise, please drop them off! I just came to sightsee, but I got in a lot of trouble!
Bianca: Hey, VAR(256, 0)! Yoo-hoo!
Bianca: VAR(256, 0)! Know what?
The professor told me Nimbasa City has a lot of things to see and do-- the amusement park, Big Stadium, Small Court, and the Battle Subway!
I'm going to go see the Pokémon Musical! See you later!
Bianca: Yoo-hoo, VAR(256, 0)!
Bianca: VAR(256, 0)! Know what?
I just had a look at the Musical Theater. It's sooo cool! Since you're here, come on, VAR(256, 0)! Come with me! Over here, over here!
OK, we're here! Let's go in!
Bianca: Ooh, VAR(256, 0)! Are you interested in musicals? Then, let's go in together!
Bianca: Daddy?! What are you doing here?
Bianca's Dad: I've come to take you back home, of course! Your mother told me that you'd made it all the way out here. Haven't you gone far enough?
Bianca: No way! I'm going to keep traveling with VAR(256, 0) and my Pokémon!
Bianca's Dad: Absolutely not! Others do things their way, and we do things ours!
Bianca: Is that so? Then, how about you do things your way, and I'll do things mine!
Sweetie, you keep going on your travels.
Bianca's Dad: Hey! Who do you think you are? This is a family matter!
My name is Elesa. I'm this town's Gym Leader. I also happen to be a model.
You know, there are many people in this world. There are people whose way of thinking may be completely different from yours. Sometimes, this means you may get hurt.
Bianca's Dad: Of course! That's exactly right! It's because I'm worried about that...
Elesa: But it's important to keep trying, to learn about the differences between yourself and others... To learn that being different is OK. And you shouldn't worry. Trainers always have Pokémon at their side. Pokémon are wonderful. It's not only how cute they can be, but also how much you can depend on them...
Bianca: Please! I know there's gonna be painful stuff like you're worrying about! I know! Really, I get it! But, like, listen... There'll be tons of nice people, too. Know what else? Since I've been traveling with Pokémon, I've already gotten tougher, I can totally tell. So...please?
Bianca's Dad: Hmm... I guess. If wanting to continue your journey is selfishness on your part, wanting to stop you is selfishness on mine. I'm surprised to find I'm the one being childish--at my age!
This Gym Leader's comments helped me wake up. Bianca, I'm sure it's better that you take the path you want to take now. I hope that your journey will be fun. Bon voyage!
VAR(256, 0), please... Take care of my little girl, OK?
Bianca: Papa, I'll come home after I find out what I really want to do!
Elesa: I'm sure he traveled as a Trainer himself, in the past... Being a parent must be hard.
Did I meddle unnecessarily? You looked troubled, so I decided to chime in.
By the way, if you're Trainers, please stop by the Pokémon Gym. I'll teach you a little something about how tough a journey can get.
I'm sorry, VAR(256, 0). I'll be waiting on Route 5.
Bianca: She's so cool! Hah! I want to be a totally cool woman like Elesa! Mm. I wonder how I'll get there. Well, before that, I guess I need to discover what I really want to do! See you later, VAR(256, 0)!
We athletes and our Pokémon show excellent teamwork! You can see it at Big Stadium and Small Court, so please stop by!
As it happens, Nimbasa City is a major destination for Pokémon battles. There are Pokémon Trainers in lots of these buildings.
Leisurely trips by train... Riding from Gear Station to Anville Town feels a bit like a dream.
Coming to flashy Nimbasa City makes me feel light and happy, as if I were holding an Air Balloon.
There are performers crowding around Route 5. Seeing all the fun the Pokémon and Trainers are having fills me with energy!
I was a good girl, so I got to go to the amusement park!
Ferris wheel! Ferris wheel! I love Ferris wheels!
Nimbasa's Pokémon Gym is in the amusement park! No doubt it has a surprising gimmick!
I won! Then I lost...
Gear Station has trains where you can battle other Trainers. The Battle Subway!
You're a Trainer, aren't you? Please just accept this without a word!
If you have a Vs. Recorder, you can record battles with friends or on the Battle Subway! Anyway, this woman of mystery will go somewhere... That's right! She'll go to the Battle Institute!
Nimbasa City Lit by the Flash of Lightning!
Big Stadium Baseball, Football, and Soccer
Small Court Tennis and Basketball
Battle Subway Battle and Ride!
Musical Theater
Trainer Tips!  Games occur at specific times in Big Stadium and Small Court! You might be able to have a Pokémon battle with your favorite athlete!
Trainer Tips!  The Musical Theater is always looking for participants! You might get more wonderful Props if you participate repeatedly!
Battle Institute! Test your Trainer Skills!

Did the fantastic speed leave you dizzy? My beloved Pokémon will be the next one to make your head spin!
My, oh my... You have a sweet fighting style. I mean, you're a great Trainer! Excuse me, I...uh... Oh, here! I want you to have this!
VAR(256, 0) received the Bolt Badge from Elesa!
If you have four Badges, including this Bolt Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 50, including traded Pokémon, will obey you. Also, here's this move I like. Feel free to use it, um, if you want to.
Volt Switch lets the Pokémon switch with a different Pokémon after attacking. Of course, if you don't have another Pokémon in your party, you can't switch.
You're going to Driftveil City next? Of course. There is a Pokémon Gym there, after all. Oh... I bet you won't be able to get there. You know what? I'll fix it so you can cross. Wait for me on Route 5.
What you'd like to do... What your Pokémon would like to do... Don't you think it could be amazing if those are aligned?
Elesa: I think the real me is the one who battles with Pokémon as a Gym Leader. A model's job is to make someone else's vision look like a reality. It's interesting, but it's not easy...
Are you cool riding a roller coaster?
When you ride a roller coaster, the speed can make you dizzy. I'm going to make your head spin with a Pokémon battle that's just as intense!
Your way of battling... It's elegant! You've got style! Even compared to Ms. Elesa!
If you press the switches, the roller coaster's path will change.
Your Nimbasa Gym challenge is finally nearing its finale. But if you don't beat me, you won't get to meet Ms. Elesa.
I'm also a Pokémon Trainer who was toughened up by Ms. Elesa. I'll show you power and style befitting this Gym.
It pleases me to be the opponent of a strong and honorable Trainer like you!
If you maintain your calm and don't get flustered by this Gym's gimmicks, you'll be able to defeat Ms. Elesa... and any other Trainer, as well!
VAR(256, 0) pressed the switch. The roller coaster's path has been changed!
How about it? I can see you're surprised! Would you ever have guessed that this Gym is a roller coaster? OK, let me fill you in... And take this, too!
In this roller coaster Gym, the first step is to get in the car. Next comes the platform! There, you can change where the coaster is going! Sometimes you continue by riding the cars of opponents you defeat. That's how you aim for the Gym Leader! By the way, Electric-type Pokémon don't do well against Ground-type moves...
Elesa uses sparkling bright Electric-type attacks! But the combination of you and your Pokémon was even more impressive! It was... It was... an emotional roller coaster!

The challenge was interrupted.
The selection was canceled.
Constant battles make me nervous. I'm taking a little rest here.
I'm going to save up Battle Points and get some items for my Pokémon to hold.
For each seven-win streak, the Trainers and Pokémon who challenge you become progressively tougher.
I've decided to use only cute Pokémon! Do you have any unique thing you're particular about?
OK! I'm all prepared! All aboard for a battle journey!
Phew...I'm worn out. These Trainers are tough. I wonder how far I'll get with my skills.
Have you heard of the Subway Bosses? They appear only to strong Trainers, and they challenge them to battles. They are the Battle Subway's bosses.
That last battle was tough... I should've traded in my BP for a better item.
If you have wooon, the trip goes ooon! Relying on Pokémon, this vagabooond!
About time to take it to the next level. Give it your best shot, too!
The Trainers here are really tough from the very start.
My 42nd straight win... Not too shabby, eh?
Can't believe I won 84 straight... Is this a dream or a hallucination?
You've got a 14-win streak! Pretty good! Not bad!
I hear the Super Train is endless! In other words, if you keep winning, you can keep going, on and on to wherever!
I can go a lot further! I can win a lot more!
The eyes of the Trainers here are very serious, or maybe you could say glinting.
Is this the best this officer can do...? The light from the passing trains seems way too bright.
The Subway Boss was a suspicious, strange fellow. I still don't believe he was giving it his all.
Challenging people is also part of my police training.
I can legally go as wild as I want! This place! It's paradise, isn't it?
My journey has just started! Neither of us can afford to lose!
Being alone on the station's platform somehow makes me feel a little sad. People leave on their journeys here, and it reminds me of those memories.
The Subway Boss was a piece of cake! Maybe I should cut loose on the Super Train next time!
The Trainers sure have become stronger. I'm feeling a little uneasy...
It looks like my Pokémon skill has reached its peak power. I couldn't let go of my dreams... I'll hang them on you, stranger, young Trainer. And this is proof. Please accept this, youngster...
I'm going to return to my home and quietly cheer myself up with art!
Oh ho ho ho... I've already done better than I did during my last challenge!
Battle between two excellent Trainers is very artistic.
For being called a Subway Boss, that Trainer sure wasn't as strong as “Boss" suggests. It was almost as if... As if they are simply gauging how strong we really are.
Well then! It's about time to get on the train!
Now just wait a minute, little Pokémon! I'll let you battle lots and lots soon!
Urk! I got motion sickness on the train...
You beat our boss, right? Not half bad, hey! And now, super Trainer, you've earned the qualification to take on the Super Train! The Trainers on the Super Train are really tough. If you want to know the essence of the Battle Subway, you should give it a try!
I'd rather have an exciting battle than slowly drive the train.
Where did you come from? And where are you going?
We Depot Agents are the protectors of peace and order in the station. We are verrry opposed to littering on the platform, shouting or playing instruments, loitering, or any activities that bother other people!
Just like how a machine needs fine-tuning, Pokémon need maintenance, too. It's a necessity. For example, rethinking the moves that a Pokémon knows.
No clumsy gimmicks... No unnecessary items... The only thing you can rely on is the strength of you and your Pokémon. This place is wonderful, isn't it?
Over 100 straight victories... If this is all due to your strength, you're even a match for the Champion.
The strength of the Trainers on the Super Train is beyond imagination!
I had a taste of it... The rush of battle... I shouldn't... It's too wild... But at this rate, I'm going to end up on the path of battlers...
Howdy! I'm a genius Pilot! Unova's finest! And I'm comin' in first here, too!
I've seen elite Trainers like me all over the place, but... Seems like the battles will be tough from here on.
Even for an elite Trainer such as myself, it's starting to get hard.
Hey, how are you doing? I'm still going strong!
I've a-done it--77 straight wins! That number has a lucky sound!
We've defeated over 300 Trainers...
My my, what a weak-looking Trainer... I think I would just get bored if I battled you... I'll give you this, so just get a little tougher, OK?
I'm only interested in strong opponents... If you get tougher, I wouldn't mind battling you.
Not many people left on the platform... Guess that shows how hard it is to keep winning on the Battle Subway.
... Huh? What? What do you want? I'm busy planning my tactics for my next battle. I don't mean to be rude, but I really need to concentrate. Would you mind not talking to me right now?
91 straight victories is nothing more than a natural result for me. My glorious record will just keep going up!
You... You have the same eyes as me. You love battling so much... No, it's not just that... Battling is your reason for living. You and I are the same type, aren't we? So...I'll give you this.
You're continuing your battle, right? That's because we are that type of person, aren't we...
I'm going to leave a rockin' record and turn into a big star!
Hey, how are you doing? I'm still going strong!
There's more to Pokémon than it seems. The world of Pokémon battling really gets deeper and deeper.
I found this when I was cleaning. You can have it if you'd like.
Oh, no need to thank me! After all, I just found it in the trash. I don't understand it. Recently, many folks have just been throwing away perfectly good things.
I may be a Janitor, but I have a lot of confidence in my abilities!
All right! Bring out your Poké Balls! Now is the time for a battle!
You like battles, too!
I can't believe a Veteran like me would get into trouble like that. Where in the world are the Trainers here training?
How are you doing, Trainer? Are you starting to get tired yet?
Mumble, mumble, mumble... In order to bring good fortune, I always think about my family before a battle.
I've been watching you battle. Nice technique and judgment... Not surprising, after a win streak like yours.
Not many people around. But each person who is still here has shown true strength.
Even a Veteran can lose to a Preschooler if they get careless. Pokémon battling requires that you always be on guard.
Just a little more to 50 straight wins! Suddenly, I'm all pumped up!
You have the face of someone who absolutely loves Pokémon battling. Even now, you're still completely hooked on battling. Amazing. Hee hee... You have a promising future!
You and I both have 91 straight wins! Which of us will reach a 100-win streak first?
Dawn and dusk behind my battles... The rocking train softly rattles... How many hours have now passed since we left Nimbasa in the past?
This is the end of the line... The trip sure ended quickly. I don't want to go home yet.
If you've made it this far, that means you've won 14 in a row. What a fluke! Fourteen is how old I am! Ha ha ha...
I'm going to let people know I'm still as active as ever!
It's the end of the line already... I guess that means my Pokémon battle journey is over for now.
Phew... This long journey is hard on this old body.
Hmm. You've got 28 straight wins, huh? This time, I want to keep going with this momentum.
You also beat the Subway Boss, right? Someday I want to battle you, too!
When my favorite Poké Ball begins to shake, I tremble with excitement! You're no ordinary Trainer, are you? Perhaps you are the Champion somewhere?
Winning battles feels good, but I've traveled quite far...I wonder if I can get back in time for work tomorrow...
I finally have a 49-battle win streak. If I can do this well at work, I wonder if I can get promoted...
Both you and I have won more than 100 straight battles! I may have too much time on my hands, but so do you. Take this to commemorate our meeting of two similar people!
It's a really precious Berry, but I don't know how to use it other than to eat it as a snack...
It's a subway map of the Unova region.

Bianca: A. Mazing. Isn't it?
Hello, you two! How do you do? I'm the owner of this theater. Pleasure to meet you!
Ooh! I must say that you two seem like phenomenal Trainers! What do we do here? We use Props to make your Pokémon fashionable and glamorous! Do you want to join in and play Dress Up? To get you started, here's a Prop Case!
This Prop Case lets you store Props for decorating your Pokémon! First off, you need to pick a Pokémon!
Aw, I'm sorry, but that Pokémon can't play Dress Up. Please choose a different Pokémon next time.
Hmm, I guess I get it! You are expressing your Pokémon's innate charm by choosing not to decorate it! Honestly, though, I think using Props would be better received in this musical.
Now, now. Don't be like that. Please reconsider and select a Pokémon!
Then... It's time to play Dress Up!
Wow! The two of you did a fantastic job coordinating everything! Utterly charming!
If you have a Pokémon who can play Dress Up, you can participate in the Pokémon Musical! Would you two please join us? The receptionist can explain everything. Let us say a brief farewell! I eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage!
Bianca: Oh, I don't know what to do! Doing the musical would be totally cool, but there's other stuff I wanna do. OK, that's it! I made up my mind! I'm going to see the sights in Nimbasa! See ya, VAR(256, 0)!
We really want you to participate in the musical! I apologize in advance if any of our Props don't suit some kinds of Pokémon. Pokémon are individuals, after all!
Wait! Please, wait! You participated in a musical with your friends, right? I felt like you opened up new possibilities for musicals! That's why I feel impelled to give you this present! Please accept it!
I eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage again!
Your continued participation makes me a happy owner! You're attracting a lot of attention as an up-and-coming stylist. Of course, I'm watching you closely, as well. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
Ah, I eagerly anticipate seeing you on stage again! ...Actually, it feels like I've said this line before. Well, that's OK. Because I'm the owner!
Seeing your continued participation makes me a happy owner. Apparently, some audience members have been calling you a top stylist as of late! Best of all... How impressive am I for recognizing your talent? Please accept this as a token of my gratitude!
I hope you continue to enjoy the musical!
Happy birthday! I've got this festive Prop to give you! It's a cake from me, the owner! Of course, this is a Prop, so you should attach it to your Pokémon and not eat it. By the way, even if today isn't your birthday, I won't take it back! Why? Because I'm the owner!
I want to make Pokémon more glamorous than ever before, so I'm researching the styles others use when playing Dress Up.
Great work! I saw your Pokémon up there today! Overall, totally VAR(291, 0)! The VAR(291, 1) Prop was a great accent. I noticed that your VAR(291, 2) factor was a bit subdued today. OK! I'm not going to lose!
Gwah!
When you play Dress Up, matching the show you're performing in is im-por-tant! If it's a good match, you can win the hearts of the audience! You'll be sure to attract attention. If you're going to get on stage, it's a waste if you don't stand out!
Pokémon Props each have their own image: cool, cute, elegant, or quirky. Before you play Dress Up, take a moment to think about the image you prefer.
I'm not trying to brag, but we're rather rich. When you say rich people, you think musical. It's a matter of taste, I guess.
It is such a treat when Trainers have played Dress Up with their Pokémon with such charming results.
Your Pokémon are wonderful! I'm always watching them. I hope you can keep entertaining us with your performances.
I always make sure to watch the shows you participate in! Even from the perspective of a rich man like me, it's impressive! It's unparalleled entertainment!
There is a Musical Photo saved from last time!
You can hang Musical Photos from your previous shows here.
Know what? When there are cute Pokémon, my eyes are glued to the stage!
Originally, people performed in this Musical Theater. One time, a Pokémon wandered up on stage and started imitating the actors. Everybody thought it was sensational! Ta-daaa! The Pokémon Musical was born.
If you are active in the musical, people will become your fans and give you Props. I don't have any Props, so I'll give you this instead!
With the move Echoed Voice, the power is boosted more and more if it's used every turn. Having a group use it might work well!
Persistence is important, so keep participating in the musical, and keep using Echoed Voice! You'll make more fans in the musical, and you'll do more damage with Echoed Voice!
Musical Theater Props + Music + Dance = Moving Spectacle!
The seats are beyond this entrance, but I think you belong on the spectacular stage!

Welcome to the musical! I'm very pleased with your participation! Participants for this musical are:
VAR(256, 3) will participate with VAR(257, 2)!
And the show you'll be performing is VAR(290, 0). That is a popular show among VAR(291, 1). Well, without further ado... Let's play Dress Up!
I guess everyone is ready. Let's go up on stage!
Good job! The Pokémon were in total sync! It was the best musical ever! I am the owner, but even I was greatly moved. Since it's the best musical ever seen, we have received many comments from the audience! There are comments for everyone, so let me give them to you in order!
Hmmm... Good job! It was a great musical! In fact, I've received comments for you from the audience! I am really pleased. I will give them to you in order!
Good job! It was quite an interesting musical! I've received comments for you from the audience! Well, I am so pleased. I will give them to you in order!
Good job! It was a musical with some very exciting moments! By the way, I received comments for you from the audience. I am quite pleased. I will give them to you in order.
VAR(256, 0)'s Dress Up performance was very VAR(291, 1)!
VAR(256, 0)'s Dress Up performance was very distinctive!
In this musical, it's not an overstatement to say that VAR(256, 0)'s Pokémon was the lead role.
The Pokémon used Props to convey such abundant expression, just as if they were actors!
Watching your Pokémon's sharp moves, I also felt VAR(291, 1)!
Your Pokémon played its role very well.
It looked like your Pokémon was making an effort to live up to your expectations. I will support your Pokémon on the side!
It was not highly noticeable... But I liked it! Keep it up!
Thank you very much for participating in the musical today! Please join another musical again! Have a great day!

When I throw a Poké Ball, I copy the form of a pitcher!
When I throw a Poké Ball, I copy the throw-in of a keeper!
Ha ha! I am a football player! I injured my hand, so I can't sign autographs! I'm sorry about that. So, what does the autograph on your Trainer Card look like?
Yeah! I am an Infielder! I hurt my hand, so I can't write an autograph! Sorry! Say, how did you sign your Trainer Card?
Bwa ha ha! I am a Striker! My hand got hurt, so I won't be able to sign any autographs! Regrets! What does your Trainer Card signature look like?

We can tell how good these professionals are just by watching them practice.
I want to be a person who is good at football and Pokémon battles!
I want to be a person who is good at baseball and Pokémon battles!
I want to be a person who is good at soccer and Pokémon battles!
On the field, they play games in earnest!
Just one ball can make people and Pokémon smile. Sports are wonderful things!
Eeeee! Turn this waaaaay!
There! There, turn like that!
Following a ball right and left makes me feel woozy.
Yahooooooo!

Athletes who score points, and athletes who support them... Determining their different roles is the key to building a team!
Football is a fun sport that is divided into offense and defense.
His... Those eyes... It looks like he's coming right at me!
The helmet and pads weigh 15 to 18 pounds!
I've trained and built up my muscles by tackling Pokémon! Nothing can move me!
OK! I will defend to the end with moves like Protect and Detect!
My favorite moves? ...Hmm. I'd say Tackle and Take Down.
Reading your opponent's attack and deciding your next move... Both Pokémon battles and football have the same thrill!
The appeal of football? Let me see... First, just watch a game without thinking about the rules!
I'll protect my team with my whole body to avoid our opponents' interference!
In football, the quarterback is the athlete who decides a strategy and carries it out. He's kind of like a Pokémon Trainer!
In football, you have to learn each and every formation by heart!
The ball used in football is oval-shaped and hard to throw, isn't it? But once you get the hang of it, you can throw it perfectly!
I am a greeeeeat secret weapon! The only problem is, I am so secret that I've never been in a game...
Yoo-hoo! Pass me the ball!

Bodies crashing into other bodies! Go, go, go! I am the owner. That’s what I like to see.

To be good at something, you have to do it repeatedly, day after day after day. That's how you get results. Otherwise, you won't get better at it.
When I was a kid, I played catch with my Pokémon!
It's not bad to grow up. But it's bad to forget what it felt like to be a child.
I have baseball, and I have Pokémon... How happy I am!
If you don't swing a bat, you can't hit a ball. If you don't do things, you won't fail... but you won't succeed, either.
I give 100 percent of my energy all the time! That is the only thing I can do.
What I brag about is my bat!

Everybody makes mistakes. But goalkeepers cannot afford a mistake, because they cannot score goals to make up for it. If one Pokémon on a team makes a mistake, however, the other Pokémon and their Trainer can cover for it!
If a Striker catches a teammate's eye, they understand each other. A Pokémon and its Trainer are the same. Don't you agree?
Really strong Trainers thoroughly do whatever they can do!
Soccer is beautiful and fun! Pokémon are also beautiful and fun!
Soccer with Pokémon is Pokémon soccer. The abbreviation is...Poccer?
Throw a sound pass to a team member! After that, to receive a sound pass, you'll need to move swiftly.
Run! Run! Just think about running!

Pokémon tennis is wonderful! Players are never alone. Their Pokémon are always with them!

Professor Juniper: Hello, VAR(256, 0)!
Cheren: Come here.
Professor Juniper: Elesa called and was asking me all about Electric-type Pokémon, and I thought about you guys. That's why I wanted to see you. Ta-da! Freebies for you!
Here, Cheren!
You, too, VAR(256, 0).
If you see a Pokémon that you want to have join you, be sure to use a good type of Poké Ball. Because this could be the first and last time you see that Pokémon!
I know it might seem strange for me to say this, since I'm the one who asked you to complete the Pokédex, but please, remember to enjoy your journey!
Of course, I'm not saying you can just neglect the Pokédex. But you know that! Now, if you'll please excuse me, I have to go meet Bianca.
Cheren: It seems the Professor gave us the Pokédex as a reason to send us on a journey. At least, that's what my mom told me. They wanted us to go out and see the world, so my mom, Bianca's mom, and your mom made a request to Professor Juniper.
VAR(256, 0), what should we do now? I think I'd like to show the professor my thanks by going to Route 4 and catching some Pokémon I haven't yet caught.
If you've come from Route 4, Nimbasa City is ahead. Next! If you've come from Nimbasa City, Route 4 is ahead!
Look at the electric bulletin board to see what's happening in Nimbasa City!

Hrmph! So yer the Trainers Elesa was talkin' about, huh. I'm Clay. I'm the Gym Leader 'round these parts. Don't be expectin' no welcome, now. 'Cause when we lowered that bridge, the Team Plasma guys we'd caught done escaped in all the ruckus!
Cheren: What a bother. We're grateful that you lowered the bridge, but how is it our fault that they escaped?
Clay: Ya can say whatever ya want. But what's important is y'all showed up, and then Team Plasma escaped. Maybe it's a little heavy-handed, but you oughtta start lookin' for Team Plasma, too. Yer both talented Trainers, aren't ya?
Tell ya what... If ya find Team Plasma, I'll let ya challenge my Gym! Life's all about give and take!
Cheren: Well, I suppose that's fair. But really, we would have looked for Team Plasma even if he hadn't asked. I can get stronger while beating that bothersome bunch...
VAR(256, 0)! I'll go on ahead.
Ghetsis: Clay. It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Ghetsis, of Team Plasma. I've come to pick up my associates who are in your care.
Clay: I don't need no thanks, now. Yer buddies were tryin' to steal some folks' Pokémon.
Ghetsis: What's this? It seems as if there has been some misunderstanding. We only free Pokémon from wicked people.
Clay: Well, that sounds real nice, if it's true. I may not talk purty, but at least I'm an honest man. You talk real nice, but what yer sayin' kinda sounds like lyin'. So tell me plain, what are ya tryin' to say?
Ghetsis: Team Plasma also has an interest in Driftveil City. And we have many, many more members besides those who are here...
Clay: ...Well, I can't tell if yer lyin' or not, but I reckon you've won this without a fight. Hrrmph. Fine. Take 'em and git!
Ghetsis: A decision worthy of a businessman called the Miner King. Your grasp of the situation is outstanding. Well then, we will be taking our colleagues off your hands...
Zinzolin: Ghetsis... Thank you very much...
Ghetsis: Don't worry, my fellow servant of the king... We are two of the Seven Sages, are we not? Well then, everyone, I expect that we will meet again somewhere.
Clay: Sorry to let Team Plasma go after you tracked 'em down, fellas. Say, why don't we cheer ourselves up with a Pokémon battle? Don't keep me waitin'!
Cheren: Well, we avoided a fight in the middle of the city, anyway. Still, I can't help but think Ghetsis isn't just an ordinary person. I'm off to go make my Pokémon stronger. I really don't want to lose to that Clay guy. Actually, I'm going to win my Gym Badge in a flawless victory!

Our Gym Leader, Clay, is in the middle of something right now. Please come again later.
Bianca: Oh, hi, VAR(256, 0)!
Bianca: VAR(256, 0)!! Guess what, guess what?
Hey, were you at the Gym just now? Oh, hey! That's Driftveil's Gym Badge! Oh, that's totally cool. That's amazing.
No, no, no! I can't get distracted being all impressed with your shiny new Badge! I'm also a Trainer! At times like this you battle, right?
Bianca: I haven't had a Pokémon battle with you in a while, VAR(256, 0). You've become totally strong, huh? I'm not that strong, so I don't know how to say it, but I think you're way tuned in to how your Pokémon feel! Oh, you know what! I want to share this HM with you, VAR(256, 0)!
Bianca: My papa gave it to me after he tried to take me home that time. I'm sure it's so I can come home anytime he wants, though... Oh, hey, I have to share this with Cheren, too... See you, VAR(256, 0)! Buh-bye!
So how about this city's pride and joy, the drawbridge? We also call it the Charizard Bridge due to its elegant form!
Hey there, Trainer! Have you ever battled the Elite Four of the Pokémon League? You can't battle them unless you have eight Gym Badges, right?
Oh, ocean... I wonder if the tears I've cried will flow all the way to Olivine City.
Those Team Plasma meanies forced me to battle them. And when I lost, they stole my Pokémon!
When I win, it's because of my Pokémon. When I lose, it's because of me. That's how I always think. If you get conceited, you get sloppy fast.
The reason I'm hangin' around is because I want to hang around! Aww! If my Pokémon just knew the move Surf, I could go on top of the water!
Some kids are catching and training Pokémon close to the Cold Storage.

A terrific Trainer! Let me share a training tip with you. During a battle with a Trainer, even if your Pokémon's items are taken away, don't worry. They will be returned to you safely after the battle. ...But disposable items seem to disappear.

Do you think all people in the world can understand one another?
I see. I think so, too!
Well...but you and your Pokémon understand each other. Isn't that right?
This happened to me once after I crossed a bridge. When I was at a loss, the person who helped me was a total stranger... After all, helping each other is important in life.
What is a strong mind? What is kindness? Are there any Trainers and Pokémon who possess those qualities?
When I go to the Entralink next time, I'd like to register a Pass Power and make everyone smile!
VAR(48649, 2)People who visited the Entralink hid items somewhere... The Entralink is unique, isn't it?VAR(48649, 0)
I want other people to like me... There is a reward... It's OK to help people with such motivations. Because helping is itself a great thing!
Living is using time given to you. You cannot recall lost time. Don't forget that...
Happiness is here today, gone tomorrow. There is no everlasting happiness, so don't be greedy.

There are medicinal herbs that make Pokémon healthy.
The medicinal herbs imported from another region work very well! But Pokémon don't seem to like them, because they taste a little bitter.
Welcome! This is straight from the farm! Moomoo Milk--one bottle for $500. Would you like some for your trip?
Here it is! Your Moomoo Milk!
Oh, my! Your Bag is full!
Oh, my! You don't have enough money!
Please buy it next time! Just so you know, our Moomoo Milk is straight from the farm. It's super fresh!
A dozen! That's 12 bottles. Here it is, your Moomoo Milk!
One bottle
One dozen
No thanks!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all sold out. That Charles guy bought everything I had.
You! Glad you came! You want something good?
Then, show me a Pokémon Lv. 30 or more!
Oh! Strong! You, great! Take this!
Oh! You--not so good yet! After training Pokémon, come back here again!
You, modest! You should just want something good!
You! Glad you came! Get good at Expert Belts!  If a Pokémon has an Expert Belt, the power of its moves is slightly boosted when they are super effective!
There must be a convenient town where everything is imported and everything is available.
Somewhere, there's a laid-back town where people value the year's seasons. I heard we've imported a lot of goods from that town!
Looking at seasonal vegetables is fun. Because when the seasons change, the vegetables available change!
Whenever we come to the market, vegetables of all seasons are available. Isn't that a marvel?
Goods carried away from Driftveil arrive in a town somewhere else... Yeah. The world is connected.

I am grateful that you came all this way! Are you a Trainer? Ooh, you have a Pokédex! It's so marvelous! I wonder if you'd please do me a favor.
Oh, Trainer. I'm so pleased that you came all the way here! I'm wondering if you would do me a favor today, too.
I would like to see a Pokémon that has learned a move called VAR(263, 0). To be clear, that's VAR(263, 0). Please show it to me today.
I would like to see a Pokémon that learned a move called VAR(263, 0). To be clear, that's VAR(263, 0). Please show it to me today. Oh, my, my, my! Your VAR(257, 1) can use VAR(263, 0)! Did you go to the trouble of teaching it to your Pokémon? Marvelous! This is a small token of my appreciation. Please don't hesitate to accept this.
I'm touched that you came all the way here, yet you are being so unkind.

Oh, my goodness. Your VAR(257, 1) can use VAR(263, 0)! You went to all the trouble of teaching it to your Pokémon? That's so touching! This is a small token of my appreciation. Please don't hesitate to accept this.
I wonder what VAR(263, 0) looks like when it is actually used. I am sure you can use it skillfully!
You know there are many kinds of Pokémon? Different kinds of Pokémon can learn different kinds of moves.

Oh! Hey! VAR(256, 0), right?
Let me see your Pokédex for a moment. What do we have here? So, you've found VAR(514, 0) Pokémon, eh?
Staggering! You've seen a Klink! You're becoming quite the Trainer.
Hmmm... You haven't seen a Klink yet, eh? Still, that's a great Pokédex!
Excuse me! I was a little excited and forgot my manners. My name is Juniper, too! Cedric Juniper. Heh! The professor who gave you the Pokédex is my daughter! That girl has told me a lot about you. It really makes my day to meet you!
In honor of our meeting, I'm going to upgrade your Pokédex!
VAR(256, 0)'s Pokédex has been upgraded!
Cedric: Some Pokémon can change forms even when it's the same individual. If you have already seen a form, you can check it with this whenever you want. I also added a function to make searching easier.
???: Professor, who's that Trainer?
Cedric: Oh! I forgot my introductions! Skyla, this is a friend of my daughter's. VAR(256, 0) is traveling around Unova to complete the Pokédex.
Skyla: Oh, I see! So that means you'll be challenging the Gym! Oh boy! I'm really looking forward to it!
Cedric: That's right, VAR(256, 0). You should challenge this Gym! If nothing else, this Gym is really out there!
See you, Skyla. If something comes up again, I'll let you know!
Skyla: Professor, my plane is a cargo plane! It carries cargo, not people! And you're talking as if places like Kanto and Sinnoh are right around the corner!
Cedric: Aww, Skyla. If you keep frowning, your face might freeze like that, and that'd be a shame. People and Pokémon, we all have to help each other out! See you later!
Skyla: Sheesh! It's hard to believe a happy-go-lucky guy like that could be a world-renowned Pokémon professor.
Heads-up, VAR(256, 0). As a Gym Leader, I'd be happy to have you challenge the Gym, but there's something I need to take care of first.
Heads-up, VAR(256, 0). As a Gym Leader, I'd be happy to have you challenge the Gym, but there's something I need to take care of first.
Just now, as I was flying the cargo plane, I saw something on top of the Celestial Tower.
I'm sure that it is a sick Pokémon! If it is, I can't just leave it there! I have to look into this right away. I'm leaving for Route 7's Celestial Tower. You can come along if you want.
Skyla completed her cargo-plane run. She must have gone somewhere after. Maybe to the Celestial Tower on Route 7?
N: VAR(48649, 1)They may say it is for understanding one another better, but what Trainers really use battles for is to compete... And they hurt each other's Pokémon! Am I the only one who finds this terribly painful? Whatever... I'm going to talk to your Pokémon. I've been living with Pokémon since I was born, so it's easier for me to talk with them than with people. ...Because Pokémon never tell lies.VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)Hey, VAR(257, 0). Would you tell me what kind of Trainer VAR(256, 1) is?VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)OK, OK, got it. So VAR(256, 1) was born in Nuvema Town, lives with Mom, and was given the Pokédex to start off a journey to see the world.VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)Still, this VAR(257, 1) trusts you for some reason. That's good! If every person and Pokémon cared about one another like you two do, I could watch over the future of people and Pokémon without having to liberate Pokémon from people who just use them.VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)Ghetsis is using Team Plasma to search for some special stones-- the Light Stone and the Dark Stone...VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)These stones hold the essence of two legendary Pokémon. It is said that when they lost their physical form, they fell into a slumber and were transformed. Now, they wait for the hero's arrival... I shall resurrect a legendary Dragon-type Pokémon from one of these stones, and become its friend. That will show the world that I am the new hero. Everyone will follow what I say!VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)My vision is to change the world without using force. Trying to change the world by force will just make others resist. If people resist, the ones that will be hurt are the innocent Pokémon used by foolish Trainers. You understand. Pokémon are not just tools for people to use!VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)As a result... Pokémon and Trainers who care about one another, like you and your Pokémon, will be separated. And that does break my heart a little. VAR(48649, 0)
Planes! Their shapes! They are perfectly designed to fly! There is no excess in the mechanics for flying!
The only planes that fly out of Mistralton Airport are cargo planes. If Trainers want to fly, they can go with a Pokémon that knows the move Fly.
Skyla's grandfather was a legendary Pilot. Skyla is our city's Gym Leader. She's a really nice person!
Pokémon and people worked together to open up desolate land and make a place where everyone could live. I'm certain that this cooperative spirit will remain unchanged.
It's dangerous to play in a landing strip, but you should be OK on ours. We only have one cargo flight a day.
I hear many people have had their Pokémon stolen by Team Plasma...
If you want to eat delicious vegetables, the ones grown in the wild are the best. As the weather and the seasons change, wild vegetables get more and more tasty. Even Pokémon like to eat wild vegetables!
Vegetables grown in a greenhouse are the best. The temperature and their nutrients are all managed systematically. Vegetables grown in a completely efficient way taste extra delicious!
Oh! You found our treasure!
Found it!
Just kidding. We don't have a Pokémon, so we planned to hide this TM until we got one. But that would be a waste, so--here! You can use it! We'll get another one from Skyla.

===============================
Hee-hee! I've been waiting for you. Did you enjoy flying with the help of the Mistralton Gym cannons? They're my pride and joy! This time, let's try something else!
You're an amazing Pokémon Trainer. My Pokémon and I are happy, because for the first time in a while, we could fight with our full strength. This is an official League Gym Badge. I think it will look good on you.
VAR(256, 0) received the Jet Badge from Skyla.
Wow, hot stuff! With that many Gym Badges, Pokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey you. Also, as thanks for a Pokémon battle that made me very happy, I want you to have this TM.
My present to you is Acrobatics. If the user doesn't have a held item, its power doubles. It's a pretty technical move. Be sure to compensate for the lack of a held item! By the way, when I flew over Twist Mountain on the way to Icirrus City... Team Plasma--is that the name? Anyway, they were heading for the city. What kind of people are they?
Icirrus City, where you'll find the next Gym, is past Route 7, just after you cross Twist Mountain. It's a hop, skip, and a jump when flying, but it's a really challenging walk. Heads up! Make sure you're ready for it!
Skyla: Are you and your Pokémon well? Our battle together was so much fun. Now, my Pokémon and I have started training again. I don't usually let people travel in my cargo plane, but battling with you was such a blast that I'd make an exception.
Please take this Fresh Water!
Just between you and me... Rock, Electric, Ice... Flying types have more weaknesses than people know about. If you use Pokémon and moves of those types, victory is practically yours! By the way, to proceed in this Gym, you climb in the cannons to move forward. The cannons go up, down, left, and right. You can get in them from anywhere!
Woo! Not many people look that good being shot out of a cannon... You make it look easy! And congratulations on your victory against the Gym Leader.

When a Pokémon learns the move Hidden Power, somehow I can tell what type that move will be! Should I tell you what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn?

If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power, the move's type would be VAR(259, 0)!

When you use the move Fly, you can return to a Pokémon Center you've already visited. But if Pokémon don't know their destinations, they cannot fly there!
Because I know a lot about planes, I can maintain them! Because I know a lot about Pokémon, I can be strong!
For the places that I cannot reach, I ask Flying- or Psychic-type Pokémon for help sometimes. I cannot even imagine everyday life without Pokémon.
Chulululuwa!
Because of this control tower, planes can fly safely in the sky where there are no roads. From that, I take this lesson: If Trainers lead Pokémon correctly, Pokémon will feel safe and fight well.
My dream was to become a Pilot and fly away, far away... I still have that dream in my heart.
Welcome to the sky city, Mistralton! Take this as a keepsake!
If a Pokémon holds an item called Sharp Beak, its Flying-type moves will be powered up!

Ah! This VAR(257, 1) has really taken a shine to you.
I can tell you're paying a lot of attention to training VAR(257, 1). Careful not to be too strict!
The Pokédex is important, but time spent having fun together is also important. Say, I just had a thought-- have you heard of Dragonspiral Tower?
Really? Quite impressive.
Eh... I'm not surprised you haven't heard of it.
OK. Give this story a listen. Dragonspiral Tower is said to be the Unova region's oldest building. Stories say it's the place where legendary Pokémon came to life or where they remain in deep slumber.

I know it's just past Icirrus City, but that's all I know about it. That's all anyone knows, because no one has ever been inside.
My daughter has wanted to investigate that tower for a long time. “What! There's something I don't know?!" That kind of feeling is pure adventure. And I'm not too old for some adventuring. Away I go to have a look at Dragonspiral Tower! Catch you later!
Cheren: VAR(256, 0), I've been talking with Bianca, and I'm wondering... Since we left Nuvema Town, has something about me...changed? Thinking about what I want to do... Thinking about what I should do... It felt like there was nothing... Have I really become stronger? Or is it just my Pokémon that have? I don't know anymore!
Bianca: Hey, hey. Cheer up, Cheren... Isn't it nice to see everyone?! VAR(256, 0)! Know what? This time, I'll go to the Pokémon Fan Club. I'm really searching... for what I want to do and what I can do!
Brycen: Who are you?
Bianca: Who? Us? I'm Bianca, and this is Cheren...
Brycen: I know you are there! Why don't you show yourselves?
...  Impressive, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. We, the Shadow Triad, are beings of the shadows...and not easily noticed.
Our mission was to speak only with VAR(256, 0), but so be it. Ghetsis has a message for you: come to Dragonspiral Tower.
It is there that our lord N waits for you. ...Now, our mission is complete.
Brycen: Dragonspiral Tower?! What's going on? Hey! Tell me...
Brycen: Now, hang on. Young man, if you're here for a Gym challenge, hang on for a bit. I've got to head to Dragonspiral Tower!
Cheren: I'm going, too. Dragonspiral Tower is to the north of here, right?
Bianca: Whoooooa! Whoa. Wh-what should I do? F-for now, I have to go to Dragonspiral Tower... OK! I'm heading north!
Bianca: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wh-what should I do? F-for now, I have to go to Dragonspiral Tower... OK! I'm heading north!

The legendary Pokémon Reshiram shared its wisdom with the hero and defied foes with columns of fire. The hero and that Pokémon were as close as a parent and child. People were filled with awe and looked up to them, and that is said to be the beginning of what became ancient Unova.

Always, the tower looms, disdainful of the wind and snow. Perhaps its presence has a special meaning for people.
The legendary Pokémon gave help to the hero who sought truth. Because of that, a region was created. Then, when its physical form was lost, the Pokémon became the Light Stone, waiting patiently for a new hero. I heard that story when I was little.

You have seven Badges. That means Pokémon up to Lv. 80 will obey you. This TM will convey my regard for your accomplishments.
A move that always results in a critical hit: Frost Breath.
No matter how many battles I fight, I don't know what strength is. Perhaps you can find the answer.
Only those who are weak need to flaunt their strength.
Brycen: In the past, when I was hurt and depressed, Alder shared this with me... There is strength in being with other people and Pokémon. Receiving their support makes you stronger. The young man named Cheren also seems to understand this now.

Oh, you are so shy! Come on, don't hide your Pokémon from me.

Alder: Hello, VAR(256, 0). This way.
Ghetsis... What a liar. Desperately trying to con everyone with his speech.
That's correct! Our lord N has combined his power with the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon and intends to create a new world. We herald the return of the hero of Unova, founder of this region.
Hero?
Dragon?
Legend!
Pokémon are different from people. They are living beings who contain unknown potential.
They are living beings from whom we humans have much to learn.
They are beings whose greatness we should acknowledge! Beings who should be freed from our oppression!
Freed?
Pokémon?
We, Team Plasma, invite you to join us! We all want to create a new world where people and Pokémon are both free! Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you now... Please, release your Pokémon. And so I end my plea to you today. Thank you one and all for your attention.
Is it true? Have we been making Pokémon suffer?
Hmm... Maybe we should release our Pokémon like Team Plasma says...
No way! Without Pokémon, I'll be lonely and sad!
What was that about? That speech was off-the-charts strange!
The cooperation of people and Pokémon is how Unova came to exist to begin with. If a Pokémon really didn't want anything to do with humans, it would simply leave... Capturing a Pokémon in a Poké Ball doesn't mean you've captured its heart.
Alder: Let's go, VAR(256, 0)!
Alder: It's been a while, Iris and Drayden.
Iris: Oh! Mr. Alder! ...And the guy who helped out that time.
Iris: Oh! Mr. Alder! ...And the girl who helped out that time.
Drayden: What's wrong? What does the wandering Champion who left the Pokémon League need from us?
Alder: Briefly, my request is this. Tell us about the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon!
Iris: Are you talking about Reshiram? Or Zekrom? What's the sudden interest?
Iris: Are you talking about Zekrom? Or Reshiram? What's the sudden interest?
Drayden: Moments ago, a troublemaker known as Ghetsis was here. He said a Trainer named N has reawakened Reshiram...
Drayden: Moments ago, a troublemaker known as Ghetsis was here. He said a Trainer named N has reawakened Zekrom...
Alder: Yes! That Trainer called N apparently told VAR(256, 0) here to search for the other Dragon-type Pokémon!
Drayden: Let me check that I have this straight. This N, or what have you, presumes to set the two Dragon-type Pokémon against each other in battle to test his convictions?
Iris: Oh, no! The Dragon-type Pokémon get along so well!
Alder: That's right, Iris. The ones who make Pokémon battle are the Trainers... And it's so the Trainers and the Pokémon can get to know each other better.
I'm going to the Pokémon League. No, I guess in this case I should say I'm “returning" to the Pokémon League! Of course, I'll defeat N! I'll teach him about the beauty of this world, where Pokémon and Trainers live together in harmony! Also, VAR(256, 0), I'll await your arrival. Once you've obtained the Opelucid Badge, come to the League! The Opelucid Gym Leader is tough. Take care!
Farewell. I'm counting on you, Drayden and Iris!
Iris: Aww... He's gone. Is he OK? He looked kinda scary.
Drayden: Don't worry, Iris. He is the strongest Trainer in all of Unova.
Well, VAR(256, 0), is it? Come to my home. As Alder asked, I'll tell you everything I can about the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon. Iris, child, please show the way.
Iris: You bet! If it's Opelucid City, I can take you anywhere. As for the story of Reshiram and Zekrom, we'll tell you all we know about it! This way!
Iris: You bet! If it's Opelucid City, I can take you anywhere. As for the story of Zekrom and Reshiram, we'll tell you all we know about it! This way!
Iris: That way!
Iris: Just a little farther!
Iris: This is it!
A challenger? I'm sorry, but currently, our Gym Leader is at home.
If all Pokémon are released, Trainers and Gym Leaders will no longer exist. For better or worse, the world would surely change...
The memories of everyone who has lived in this city have built up over the years without changing much.
This city changes endlessly. And every change is engraved in the memories of the people who live here.
I spent so many happy days training my Pokémon as we grew stronger together... If it will make my beloved Pokémon a perfect being, however, I can't help but let it go.
Even if it is inconvenient, I think some things shouldn't be changed.
Even if you love them, I think some things have to be changed.
Hey hey! That person called N had the legendary Pokémon with him, so he has to be the legendary hero, right? He's going to change the world, isn't he?
I like older things better than new ones. They're just more relaxing!
I like newer things better than old ones. They're just so cool!
...No way! Without Pokémon, I'll be too lonely and sad! But am I only using my Pokémon, then...?
The Gym Leader Iris is still a child, but the mayor Drayden has recognized her power!
The Gym Leader Drayden is the mayor who leads Opelucid. He is always training by wrestling with Pokémon.
So, have we really been making our Pokémon suffer...?
Yes, I will keep moving forward together with my Pokémon. Even if I were to part ways with my Pokémon, it wouldn't be because someone else said to, but because we decided to.
I'll definitely keep moving forward together with my Pokémon. I won't take their company for granted. I'll appreciate how amazing that is!
The legendary Pokémon is the symbol of Unova. Does that mean Team Plasma is right? ...I don't know.
Pursuing ideals is different from person to person and Pokémon to Pokémon. In this city, it seems the ideal is to cherish the past.
The truth people pursue is different from person to person and Pokémon to Pokémon. In this city, it seems the truth is constant change.
The hopes of an ancient people are put into this melody... I will bring them back to us now.
Our hopes are put into this melody... I will send them to the future.
Professor Juniper: ...Hello! How was Iris doing?
Professor Juniper: ...Hello! Was Drayden as tough as ever?
Oh, I came to report on how to resurrect the legendary Zekrom. I thought it would be better to tell you in person than over the Xtransceiver. And as for the conclusion... Well, I haven't figured it out yet. I'm sure the Pokémon will wake up when it deems someone worthy.

More importantly, aren't you amazing! You have all eight of Unova's Gym Badges now, right? You've become so strong! You probably don't even know it, but you've changed a lot since you left Nuvema Town. Well then, I'll show you where such a strong Trainer should head next!
Professor Juniper: Pass through that gate, go down Route 10, and you'll arrive at the Badge Check Gates! Once you get through Victory Road, which is past the gates, you're finally at the Pokémon League!
Oh, that just made me think of when I was showing you around the Pokémon Center in Accumula Town. VAR(256, 0)? Do you regret setting out on your Pokémon journey?
Professor Juniper: Oh! That's OK, don't worry! You don't have to tell me everything. But I'm very happy that you three chose to train Pokémon! Because they create chances to meet more wonderful people and Pokémon!
Professor Juniper: Thanks! That's the greatest answer you could give! I was really happy to be able to give you three those Pokémon as a present! Because Pokémon create chances to meet more wonderful people and Pokémon!
VAR(256, 0), this is a present for you!
Professor Juniper: This Master Ball is the most powerful kind of Poké Ball. It can catch any Pokémon without fail. This is the only way I can support you, except to say... Be true to yourself. No matter what happens, stay strong and keep going with your Pokémon! See you!

Hi! I'm Iris, the amazingly strong Gym Leader! Tell me... What Pokémon are you using? How will you fight? Ooh, I'm super curious, so let's just get started!
Whoooa! That was so cool! I'm sooo happy I could battle a Trainer as strong as you!
VAR(256, 0) received the Legend Badge from Iris.
Hey, that's your eighth Badge, right? That's so cool! Now every Pokémon will do what you ask, no matter how big they are! Know what? I'll give you this TM, too!
Dragon Tail doesn't just do damage. It sends the other Pokémon back to its Poké Ball, too!
Ooh, hey! I wonder how Mister Alder is doing? I wonder if he's battling that Trainer called N in the Pokémon League right now? Do you know about the Pokémon League? It's past Victory Road, at the end of Route 10!
You've been on a journey and seen a lot of the world. I'm like that, too! I'm from way out in the country. I'm really happy that I've gotten to meet lots of different people and Pokémon!!
You've been on a journey and seen a lot of the world. I'm like that, too! I'm from way out in the country. I'm really happy that I've gotten to meet lots of different people and Pokémon!!
Welcome. Thank you for coming. I am Opelucid Pokémon Gym's Leader, Drayden. As the mayor, I've given everything to developing the city. As a Trainer, I've simply been pursuing greater strength. But what I'm searching for now is a young Trainer who can show me a bright future. Perhaps you can show me that future, the way Iris has?
Wonderful. I'm grateful we had a chance to meet and battle.
VAR(256, 0) received the Legend Badge from Drayden!
Well, now. You've obtained all of the Gym Badges in Unova. Now, all Pokémon will obediently follow your commands. I also want you to have this. It's a TM I'm particularly fond of. It's called Dragon Tail.
Dragon Tail is a move that returns the damaged Pokémon to its Poké Ball. In other words, it switches your opponent's Pokémon.
Now, I have something to ask of you. Head for the Pokémon League and go after Alder. The Pokémon League is past Route 10, which runs from Opelucid City to Victory Road. I know Alder's strength, but I don't know the depths of N's power...
Pokémon and people do not age because of the passage of time. They get old when the energy flowing in their hearts dries up. This energy in our hearts is powered by truth, ideals, or maybe dreams... That probably changes with what you most hope for in your life.
Thanks for coming! I happily welcome you! But... I may be a little rough on you!
Advancing or retreating is up to you. But if you proceed, prepare yourself! Moving forward halfheartedly is disrespectful to your Pokémon!
Welcome to the Opelucid Gym, the Unova region's strongest and biggest trial! First off, please take this Fresh Water. It'll help you in the challenge ahead.
Let me give you a brief explanation of the trick to the Opelucid Gym! The path around this Gym is shaped like two dragons. This path changes when you step on the switches on the dragons' arms. Pay attention to how the dragons' necks move!
You beat the Gym Leader? Wow, that's amazing! Oh, by the way, since I gave you all that Fresh Water... Don't you owe me some of your winnings? ...I'm kidding! It's just a joke! No, seriously, congratulations!

Drayden: I'll explain. What you are holding is the Dark Stone. Zekrom, who will likely awaken from the Dark Stone, and Reshiram, who is already awake, were once the same Pokémon.
Drayden: I'll explain. What you are holding is the Light Stone. Reshiram, who will likely awaken from the Light Stone, and Zekrom, who is already awake, were once the same Pokémon.
Iris: That single Dragon Pokémon, along with twin heroes, brought a new region into being. And people and Pokémon had happy lives!
Drayden: One day, however... The twin heroes, the older brother who sought the truth, and the younger brother who sought ideals, began to argue about how to decide which one of them was right... The single Dragon-type Pokémon that had been with them all that time split its body into two. One sided with the older brother, and the other with the younger brother.

The single Dragon-type Pokémon that had been with them all that time split its body into two. One sided with the older brother, and the other with the younger brother.
Iris: In its pursuit of truth, the white Dragon-type Pokémon sought to usher in a new and better world... Its name was Reshiram. And the other, the black Dragon-type Pokémon, sought ideals and to usher in a new world--a world of hope. Its name was Zekrom.
Iris: In its pursuit of ideals, the black Dragon-type Pokémon sought to usher in a new and better world... Its name was Zekrom. And the other, the white Dragon-type Pokémon, sought truth, and to usher in a new world--a world of good... Its name was Reshiram.
Drayden: Because the two of them were once the same entity, their battle raged endlessly and neither one could be declared the winner. They simply exhausted themselves. The twin heroes proclaimed that there was no one side that was right and ceased the conflict.
Iris: But, but... The two heroes' sons started the battle again! And an instant later, Reshiram and Zekrom destroyed Unova with fire and lightning! Then, they disappeared! But, but... If people work with Pokémon in the right way, we don't have to worry anymore about the world being destroyed. I mean, Reshiram and Zekrom worked hard for everyone and made a new region! So, it should be all right, I think.

Drayden: True. Pokémon cannot speak. People may hurt Pokémon even more by imposing their selfish thoughts on them. But, no matter what, Pokémon and people believe in each other, need each other, and will continue to live together...
Iris: Yeah! So I'm never gonna forgive Team Plasma for trying to separate Pokémon and us!
Drayden: Sorry. We got a little off topic at the end. That is everything we know. Unfortunately, we don't know how to wake up the legendary Pokémon...
Drayden: I made a promise to Alder. You must win the Gym Badge from the Opelucid Pokémon Gym.
Iris, you go and be VAR(256, 0)'s opponent at the Pokémon Gym.
Iris: Yay! Look out! I'm really, really strong, just like Drayden!
VAR(256, 0), I'll be waiting for your challenge at the Pokémon Gym!
Drayden: What will it accomplish to separate the worlds of people and Pokémon? The way we live now, with different beings understanding and forgiving each other, is much richer. That's my belief.
Iris: Everyone, people and Pokémon can get along and be happy. That's awesome!

I am coaching Iris. But, honestly, she's been stronger than me ever since she came here!
The move Draco Meteor that Drayden teaches us is the strongest Dragon-type move. However, it will sharply reduce Special Attack after use.

Concerned about your Pokémon's weight? You don't need to put it on a diet! Just let it hold this.
The weight of a Pokémon holding a Float Stone will be halved! That way, you can reduce the damage caused by weight-based moves such as Low Kick and Grass Knot.
I have an item that I don't know how to use. Would you give it a try and see if you can make it work?
I know... You'll also have trouble figuring it out.
You may be able to master it. Here it is!
If a Pokémon holds a Ring Target, it can be hit even by a move that would usually have no effect. For example, a Normal-type move would hit a Ghost-type Pokémon. Mastering this item is a bit tough... Actually, it's very tough, but think how useful it could be!

I want to know the future! I am very worried... I wonder how my child, Thyme, will spend the future. I'm making a machine that connects the future and the present, but electricity is desperately short.
I've heard that in another world, there's another Opelucid City that looks very futuristic. If there is a Pokémon from that world that knows the move Charge, the machine may work. If you're able, would you be willing to lend me a Pokémon like that?
I...I see. What a pity. If you change your mind, please return.
Th-thank you! Now my machine will work!
I appreciate the thought, but...you don't have a Pokémon that meets the conditions I need.
I appreciate the thought, but although your Pokémon knows Charge, it's not from that other world...
Now, please show me the future!
Whirrr, whirrr, whirrr...
Oh! So that's what the future is like! My precious Thyme is growing up as such a good kid!
Oh, it returned to normal... But what an experience! I can't stop trembling! And even though I know the future, I guess my present time won't change.
I will return your Pokémon to you. This is my thank-you gift.
Rather than worrying about the future, it is important to live in the present, which connects to the future, as best you can. OK, Thyme! Let's go out later! Today, let's play as hard as we can!
Thyme: I, I... What will I be when I grow up?
I want to return to the past! I want to do many things over again! My father, Bach, created a machine to see the future. I am making a machine to connect with the past. ...But I don't have enough electricity.
I've heard that in another world, there's another Opelucid City that looks very old-timey. If there is a Pokémon from that world that knows the move Charge, the machine may work. If you're able, would you be willing to lend me a Pokémon like that?
Ah... What a pity. There is no other way...
Yes! Now, the machine will work.
You're nice to offer, but I'm afraid you don't have a Pokémon that meets the conditions I need.
That's nice of you, but although your Pokémon knows Charge, it's not from that other world...

We connected with the past! Father! It's me, Thyme! I owe you an apology...

Oh! I will return your Pokémon to you. Thank you. This is my thank-you gift.
Rather than regretting the past... it is important to live in the present, which connects from the past, as best as you can. OK! I'll live positively!

“Eyes brimming with dark flame, this man   rejected everything other than himself   in order to bring about one   singular justice..." That's part of a novel I'm writing.

I'm the Elite Four's Ghost-type Pokémon user, Shauntal, and I shall be your opponent.
S-sorry! First, I must apologize to my Pokémon... I'm really sorry you had a bad experience because of me! Oh! It's not your fault! This is how battles always are. Even in light of that, I'm still one of the Elite Four!

Challenger, if you defeat the entire Elite Four of the Pokémon League, you can go on to challenge the Champion. And you have earned that right. Your story is yours and yours alone. Please weave a wonderful tale!

Man oh man... What is going on today? Challengers coming one right after another. Well, no matter. I am Grimsley of the Elite Four, and I will fulfill my duty to be your opponent.
Whether or not you get to fight at full strength, whether or not luck smiles on you--none of that matters. Only results matter. And a loss is a loss. See, victory shines like a bright light. And right now, you and your Pokémon are shining brilliantly.
Now, I'm nothing more than the guy who lost... Nothing more, nothing less. Sigh... You should take that strength and test it against the rest of the Elite Four.
Astonishing! You have defeated every member of the Pokémon League's Elite Four. But it isn't over yet. There is one more opponent against whom you must prove your strength. The pinnacle of the Pokémon League, the Champion, Alder... Or, perhaps, that man called N has defeated him and taken his title. I don't know which one you will face, but check the statue in the central plaza, and continue to the final room.
Life is a serious battle, and you have to use the tools you're given. It's more important to master the cards you're holding than to complain about the ones your opponents were dealt. Let us begin. And may the best Trainer win! Contests like this are proof that you are really living...
There are bad ways to win-- and good ways to lose. What's interesting and troubling is that it's not always clear which is which. A flipped coin doesn't always land heads or tails. Sometimes it may never land at all...
Excellent! The nice thing about Pokémon battles is they teach the loser something, as well. That said... You should take that strength and test it against the rest of the Elite Four!

Greetings, challenger. My name is Marshal. In order to master the art of fighting, I'm training under my mentor, Alder. My mentor sees your potential as a Trainer and is taking an interest in you. It is my intention to test you--to take you to the limits of your strength. Kiai!
Whew! Well done! As your battles continue, aim for even greater heights!
Representing the Pokémon League in the absence of the Champion has been my duty as Alder's student. However, there is nothing as empty as words not backed up by strength. A word in your ear, strong challenger... The other members of the Elite Four are far more powerful than I am. Do not underestimate them!
Now... You have become the strongest Trainer in this Pokémon League. The statue in the central chamber will take you to the Champion's room. We, the Elite Four of Unova, are sworn to follow the Champion's order to be neutral. So the rest is up to you!
I thank you deeply for the chance for another round of combat against you. In myself, I seek to develop the strength of a fighter. And shatter any weakness in myself! Prevailing with the force of my convictions! Victory, decisive victory, is my intention! Challenger, here I come!
There are still many strong Trainers in this Pokémon League. You should deepen your bonds with your Pokémon by battling with them.
In times past, I wandered all the regions of the world in pursuit of strength... One day, I met my mentor and began to grasp the wisdom of making strength an internal quality... And one day, I decided to become part of the Elite Four of Unova... For some reason, the battle we just had brought those fateful times back to mind.
The strength shown by you and your Pokémon has deeply impressed me... Please, continue to the next room to face the strongest Trainer of the Unova region!

Who are you? How impudent you are to disturb my sleep. Hmf... You appear to possess a combination of strength and kindness. Very well. Make your best effort not to bore me with a yawn-inducing battle. Clear?
You haven't faced all of the members of the Elite Four yet, have you? Don't concern yourself about me. Go on ahead.
In the past, when I battled, the force of my emotions shook me greatly. When my power awoke, I came close to destroying everything around me. That weak person no longer exists... Still, sometimes, my determination fails. Always, I aspire to wrap up a victory with elegance and grace. I invite you to be my opponent again in the future, if you wish.
Somehow, you managed to defeat the entire Elite Four of the Pokémon League. Check the statue in the center of the plaza for the way to the Champion's room.
Who's there? Who is so uncouth as to disturb my sleep? Hmf... It's you again. Still, you possess that combination of kindness and strength. Yet you seem stronger than before... Do be sure not to bore me with a snooze-inducing battle, is that clear?
Alas! Even with the knowledge and skill passed down in my family of Trainers, I still can't win. The reason I came here in the first place was to encounter Trainers like you...
In the past, my untrained heart made my power run wild. I was forbidden to battle. All I craved then was to experience the pure excitement of battling like this. Hee hee... Although I'm embarrassed, I can't help smiling right now.
You have defeated the Pokémon League's Elite Four. You have earned the right to proceed to the Champion's room. Making an entrance is not the point. Once you're there, you'll need to unleash your power to the fullest!

Alder: Er... I have to congratulate you.
Cheren: I became stronger because I understood what I want to do.
VAR(256, 0)! Tell N this... Some people grow stronger by being with Pokémon. My Pokémon and I are proof. Together, we learned and became stronger.
Cheren: I'll look after Alder. You go on.
Alder: I... I lost. I should have been able to demonstrate the bond between me and my Pokémon. That would have shown that brat the worthlessness of his outrageous dreams. So, his convictions were the real thing... Be careful. The ones who change the world are always the ones who pursued their dreams. VAR(256, 0), I ask this of you. Even if Pokémon and people are separated, nothing good will come of it. Please let him know that!

Alder: I've really been looking forward to deciding who's the strongest Pokémon Trainer in the Unova region! Kiai!
Alder: Well done! You certainly are an unmatched talent! Come with me!

Hello, and welcome to Unity Tower! Would you like to go upstairs?
Indeed. Please step inside the elevator.
Please come again.
This is Unity Tower. Trainers from all over the world cross borders and oceans to gather here. Visit whichever floor you like! The more people you know worldwide, the more floors you can visit. Please enjoy all that we have to offer!
Right now, the number of visitors in Unity Tower is VAR(513, 11).
Wow! So you like VAR(296, 6), then!
Awesome! The ceiling is sooo high! I wonder how many of me you'd have to stack up to reach it?
Coming to Unity Tower always gets me excited! Being here always reminds me of how big the world really is!
You're a new face. Is this your first time here? Unity Tower is the place where Trainers come from all over the world. That's why I work hard every day doing security checks to protect those young Trainers. Don't loiter around here and cause trouble. ...'Kay, you can pass.

Seems like I've met you somewhere... Anyway, don't get too wound up and fall. When guests get hurt, it causes me no end of trouble. ...'Kay, you can pass.
Oh! So you're a Trainer, then! I see. You're far from family and traveling the world, huh? I suppose it's fine if you contact them once in a while. 'Kay, you can pass.
Oh, it's you. Hmm... You like trading, do you now? Well, that's all right, isn't it. You're active--just like a young person should be. 'Kay, you can pass.
Oh, it's you. Seems like you come here a lot. Do you have friends all over the world? I'd never have imagined a world like this when I was young. 'Kay, you can pass.
Oh, it's you, VAR(256, 3)! Lately, lots of Trainers have been looking for you. You're just like a movie star, aren't ya? When I was your age, the ladies used to get worked up over me. Ha ha. 'Kay, you can pass.
Hey, it's you, VAR(256, 3)! Recently, it looks like there have been lots of global Trainers like you. That means--how do I put it--world peace can't be far off! Should I get my hopes up? 'Kay, pass on through!
Oh, it's you, VAR(256, 3)! It feels like since you've started coming, Unity Tower has gotten busier. There's been a lot more work for this old guy, but that's a problem I'm happy to have. Keep up the good work!
Hey, VAR(256, 3). You've managed to trade with folks in even more places, huh? That's really something! I'd imagine your Pokédex is getting pretty full, then? Wow, you're amazing! 'Kay, pass on through.
Hey, VAR(256, 3). Unity Tower is as lively as ever with people who come here to see you. Well, enjoy yourself today!
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3)! What? F-fifty countries?! I've never seen a Trainer who has traded with folks in over 50 countries! How in the world did you manage that? 'Kay, please pass through--and feel free to wander around!
Hey, it's you, VAR(256, 3). After trading with this many people, you must have friends all over the world! Ha ha. If you go on a trip, no worries about not knowing anyone, huh? 'Kay, please pass through!
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3)! I almost feel like I don't need to bother with a security check for you anymore. You can go ahead and pass. ...Gotcha! I've been a security guard for 30 years! I know trouble just waits for you to let your guard down. ...'Kay, you can pass.
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3). I'll just do a brief security check. ...W-what's this? Ooh, it's a kind of gum I've never seen! Is it a new brand? Maybe I'll buy some later. 'Kay, you can pass.
Why, if it isn't VAR(256, 3). Just a little more, and you'll have traded with every place here, huh? It's really reassuring to me that kids like you are going to be the ones running the world! Just a little more to go. You can do it! 'Kay, you can pass!
It's you, VAR(256, 3)! I already heard! You've finally managed to trade with people from every location, right? It might just be me, but Unity Tower feels more exciting when you visit. I'm sure it's happy to see you. Hey, VAR(256, 3), I'd like to give my thanks as the Unity Tower guard for making this building out in the middle of nowhere so lively. 'Kay, you can pass. Think of this place as your own backyard and feel free to go where you please.
Please select a floor.
Hey, you over there! Come here for a second.
Don't just loiter around and cause trouble.
Don't get too wound up. If you run around, fall, and get hurt, it'll cause me no end of trouble.
I suppose it's fine if you contact them once in a while. I'm sure it'll make your folks happy.
That's all right. You're active--just like a young person should be. Do your best!
Do you know people all over the world? I never would've imagined a world like this when I was young.
When I was your age, the ladies used to get worked up over me. Ha ha!
Recently, it looks like there have been lots of global Trainers like you.
It feels like since you started coming, Unity Tower has gotten busier. Keep up the good work!
I'd imagine your Pokédex is getting pretty full, then? Well, that's really something.
Unity Tower is as lively as ever with people who come here to see you. Well, hope you enjoy yourself today.
How in the world did you manage to trade with so many different places?
You must know a lot of people in different places in the world. Ha ha. Even if you go on a trip, no worries about not knowing anyone, huh?
I've been a guard for 30 years. Today, all is well, too. Mmm... That's great!
I think I'll try buying that new gum next time.
When I see you, I suddenly feel very sure that the future will be full of hope.
When you visit, Unity Tower gets exciting! Think of this place as your own backyard and feel free to go where you please.

Come to VAR(293, 1) sometime, OK, VAR(256, 3)? It's a super place!
VAR(256, 7): Oh, if it isn't VAR(256, 3)! How are you? I didn't think there were many people who liked VAR(296, 10). I found several people with the same hobby after trading with Trainers from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! VAR(293, 1) didn't have so many. Hmm. I guess the rest of the world is definitely a little different!
???: Y-y-you! VAR(256, 3)! Meeting you in a place like this, what a surprise! ...Huh? Don't you remember me? VAR(256, 7)! From VAR(293, 1)! Come on!

VAR(256, 7): The world is wide! It's absolutely huge! But whatever ocean you cross, there are people who enjoy VAR(296, 10). Like me! Is it some kind of miracle? I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! But I want to trade more and more and get to know lots of people who like VAR(296, 10) and VAR(258, 5)! We should trade again someday, my friend!
VAR(256, 7): Do you like VAR(296, 10)?! I love it! Where I live, in VAR(293, 1), many people share my hobby, but I never would have suspected VAR(296, 10) fans could be found in so many places. I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! And if I trade more, I'll bet there will be plenty more people with the same hobby! Yeeeaaah! That gets me pumped!
VAR(256, 7): The VAR(258, 5) I got from you! ...It's awesome! Thank you! I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! But VAR(258, 5) is special! VAR(256, 3)! Someday, we should enjoy VAR(296, 10) together in VAR(293, 1)! Until we meet again, VAR(256, 3)!
VAR(256, 7): Get a load of this, VAR(256, 3)! I've traded Pokémon with amazing Trainers in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! And many of them also like VAR(296, 10) and VAR(258, 5)! We may live in different places, but we like the same things! And... We may have been raised in different places, but we like the same things! That's astonishing, don't you think? The world's a magical place! Our meeting is also magical! Let's trade again sometime, VAR(256, 3)!
???: Hey! I remember you! You're VAR(256, 3), right? Do you remember me? It's VAR(256, 7)! Hee hee! Remember? I'm from VAR(293, 1)! Thanks for trading me VAR(258, 5) that time! Is VAR(258, 9) doing well? Trading Pokémon with you was really inspiring! It's really nice to see you again, VAR(256, 3)! Let's trade again sometime!
VAR(256, 7): Oh! Hi, VAR(256, 3)! Hee hee. Know what?! I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! Isn't it awesome? Great? Hee hee! Oh! Oh! Some of the people I traded with like VAR(296, 10), just like me! VAR(256, 3), how many people like VAR(296, 10) where you live? VAR(293, 1) has quite a few. Well, I'll see you later, VAR(256, 3)!

VAR(256, 7): Know what? I thought this after trading with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! It's normal for people to be different! If the things you like are different, your hobbies will be different, too! There's no reason for everyone to like VAR(296, 10). I think that's interesting! Because when you do something different, doesn't it feel like your world has become larger somehow? Stepping out of VAR(293, 1) sometime will be good for sure!
VAR(256, 7): Hey, VAR(256, 3). Have you ever been to VAR(293, 1)? You can enjoy VAR(296, 10) there, and it's a pretty nice place. But I thought this after I tried trading with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! I'm sure there are just as many nice things in other places. Don't you get super excited when you think about that? OK, I'll see you later, VAR(256, 3)! Let's trade again, OK!

VAR(256, 7): Ah hyuk hyuk! I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8)! Everyone has different hobbies. It's really interesting... Wha--? My hobby? It's VAR(296, 10). Ah yup! If you ever feel like coming to my home, VAR(293, 1), you should! I'm sure it'll be a fun trip for you.
VAR(256, 7): M-my hobby is VAR(296, 10)...but have you met other people through trading who like it? I've traded with people from VAR(514, 8) places, but everyone has different hobbies. If you live somewhere different, your hobbies must be different, too. ...Well, anyway. That's good, too.
VAR(256, 7): M-my hobby is VAR(296, 10), but... What about you? ...Phew. T-truth is, I'm not very comfortable talking with people. Despite that, I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)... And I also got your VAR(258, 5)... Hyuk hyuk. I-I think I want to trade some more. Thank you. Hope we can trade again sometime.
VAR(256, 7): I-I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! And some of them liked VAR(296, 10), too... Even on the other side of the world, some people have the same hobby as me... By the way, have you ever been to VAR(293, 1), where I live? It's a fun place, so I think you might like to visit...

Trading has become a little more fun, hasn't it?
VAR(256, 7): Umm... How is VAR(258, 9)? No, if they're fine, that's all that matters. VAR(258, 5) is doing great... Very good... Yes. Would you come to VAR(293, 1) sometime soon? It's a nice place where you can enjoy VAR(296, 10). ... ...Come for sure, OK! Tee hee!

Let's trade again sometime...
VAR(256, 7): Have you ever been to VAR(293, 1)? It's a lovely place. I hope you come sometime. I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! I've worked hard...huh? You can learn about the hobbies of the Trainers you trade with. Kind of fun, isn't it? ...Me? I like VAR(296, 10). Expecting something different? Tee hee.
VAR(256, 7): Tee hee. How many places are the people you've traded Pokémon with from? Right now for me it's this many places: VAR(514, 8)... But, I want to trade more and more... Because if I do, I might meet someone who likes VAR(296, 10) and VAR(258, 5), too! ...It feels like destiny! Tee hee. And someday, I'll have them come visit VAR(293, 1)... It's a very nice place... Tee hee. ...Oh, sorry! My imagination was running wild. ...Let's trade again sometime, VAR(256, 3)... Hee hee!

VAR(256, 7): Hey there, VAR(256, 3). Lately, I've gotten hooked on VAR(296, 10). It's just so much fun. Come to VAR(293, 1) sometime, and let's hang out!

VAR(256, 7): Why, VAR(256, 3)! Hello! Are you here because you've traded Pokémon with people living far away? Hee hee!

VAR(256, 7): Oh! VAR(256, 3)! Hi, VAR(256, 3)! Hee hee. Know what?! I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). Isn't it awesome? Great? Hee hee! Oh! Oh!

VAR(256, 7): You know what? I thought this up after trading with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). It's normal for people to be different! If the things you like are different, your hobbies will be, too! There's no reason for everyone to like VAR(296, 10). I think that's interesting! Because when you are doing something different, doesn't it feel like your world has become larger? Stepping out of VAR(292, 0) sometimes is good for sure!
VAR(256, 7): Hey, VAR(256, 3). Have you ever been to where I live in VAR(292, 0)? You can enjoy VAR(296, 10) here, and it's a pretty nice place.

If you ever feel like coming to my home, VAR(292, 0), you should! I'm sure it'll be a fun trip for you. Hyuk hyuk...
VAR(256, 7): M-my hobby is VAR(296, 10), but have you met anyone through trading who likes VAR(296, 10)? I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). And everyone has different hobbies. If you live somewhere different, your hobbies must be different, too. ... ... Uh, whatever. That's good, too.
VAR(256, 7): M-my hobby is VAR(296, 10), but... What about you? ...Phew. T-truth is, I'm not very comfortable talking with people. Despite that, I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)... And I also got your VAR(258, 5)... Hyuk hyuk. I-I think I want to trade some more. Thank you. Hope we can trade again sometime.
VAR(256, 7): I-I've traded with  people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). And then, some of those people liked VAR(296, 10), too... Even on the other side of the world, there are people who share my hobby... By the way, have you ever been to VAR(292, 0), where I live? It's a fun place, so I think you might like to come... Hyuk hyuk.
VAR(256, 7): H-how many different places are the people you've traded Pokémon with from? F-for me, it's this many places: VAR(514, 8)... Um, err... Have you ever been to where I live, VAR(292, 0)? Th-there are people who like VAR(296, 10). Oh, of course I like that, too! I-it's a very nice place, so come visit sometime...
???: You... You're... VAR(256, 3), right? It's me! You know, VAR(256, 7) from VAR(292, 0)! Do you remember me? Tee hee! I'm happy to see you again. Thanks for giving me VAR(258, 5) that time. Is VAR(258, 9) doing well? Meeting here again must be fate! Tee hee! Looking forward to seeing you again!
VAR(256, 7): What's that? How many places have you traded Pokémon with? I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). It's a little scary trading with strangers... ...But it also makes my heart race a bit. Sometimes I meet people whose hobby is VAR(296, 10), too! ...Tee hee! Trading has become a little more fun, hasn't it?
VAR(256, 7): Umm... How is VAR(258, 9)? No, um, if it's fine, that's all that matters. VAR(258, 5) is doing great. Very good... Yes. Any chance you might come to VAR(292, 0) sometime? It's a nice place where you can enjoy VAR(296, 10). ... ...Come for sure, OK! Tee hee!
VAR(256, 7): Tee hee! Hey, VAR(256, 3). What is your hobby? Mine is VAR(296, 10). ...What do you think? How many places have the people you traded with come from? As for me... Tee hee! I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). I'm going to trade more and more, so I can find people who like VAR(258, 5)... Tee hee hee! Well, I'll see you again, VAR(256, 3). Let's trade again sometime...
VAR(256, 7): Have you ever been to VAR(292, 0)? It's a lovely place. I hope you come sometime. I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). I've worked hard...huh? You can learn about the hobbies of Trainers you trade with. Kind of fun, isn't it? ...Me? I like VAR(296, 10). Expecting something different? Tee hee!
VAR(256, 7): Tee hee! How many places do they come from, these people you've traded with? For me, it's this many places: VAR(514, 8)... But, I want to trade more and more... Because if I do, I might meet someone who likes VAR(296, 10) and VAR(258, 5), too! ...It feels like destiny! Tee hee! And someday, I'll have them come visit VAR(292, 0)... It's a very nice place... Tee hee! Oh, sorry! My imagination was running wild. Let's trade again sometime, VAR(256, 3)... Hee hee!
???: Oh! VAR(256, 3), isn't it? I'm VAR(256, 7). Hey, do you remember me? The one from VAR(292, 0)! Recently we traded your VAR(258, 5) and my VAR(258, 9), remember? Hey, well, I'm happy to see you! If you'd like, let's have a nice chat one of these days!
VAR(256, 7): Hey there, VAR(256, 3). Recently, I've gotten quite hooked on VAR(296, 10). It's just so much fun! Come to VAR(292, 0) sometime, and let's hang out! By the way, how many places are your traded Pokémon from? I've traded with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). Yeah... I'd sure like to trade with a lot more places.
VAR(256, 7): Hey there, VAR(256, 3). I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). Whoa, people sure do have a lot of different hobbies! What? My hobby? It's VAR(296, 10), I suppose. I enjoy it for some reason. Are there a lot of people near you who like VAR(296, 10)? In VAR(292, 0), where I live, I suppose there are a few. Well, VAR(256, 3), let's trade again sometime!
VAR(256, 7): Hey, VAR(256, 3)! How many places are the people you've traded Pokémon with from? I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). Some people among them like VAR(296, 10), just like me! Somehow, trading with people in a lot of different places makes even the far side of the world feel closer. Come to VAR(292, 0) sometime, if you want to! It's a pretty nice place!
VAR(256, 7): Hey, VAR(256, 3)! Nice to see you again! How are you doing? Well, I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). Heh heh. It's fun, and you can learn about your trading partner's hobbies. What, me? I guess I enjoy VAR(296, 10). By the way, have you ever been toVAR(292, 0)? It's a pretty nice place. Come visit sometime.
VAR(256, 7): You know, when I'm enjoying VAR(296, 10), I lose track of time. But I guess that's what hobbies are all about. How many places are the people you've traded with from? I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! When you're trading, you lose track of time, just like with a hobby. That's why I'm late for everything. You believe me, right? Aw, I suppose fun things are always like that. Hey, VAR(256, 3). Come to VAR(292, 0), all right!? We'll have so much fun, you'll lose track of time!
???: So we meet again, VAR(256, 3). Do you remember me? I'm VAR(256, 7) from VAR(292, 0)! Come on, now. We traded your VAR(258, 5) and my VAR(258, 9) recently, right? I'm really happy to meet you again!
VAR(256, 7): Oh, it's VAR(256, 3)! You know what? I've traded with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8)! And a lot of people who also like VAR(296, 10) live all over the world. Hey, VAR(256, 3), if you'd like, come to VAR(292, 0) someday, hee hee!
VAR(256, 7): Oh! VAR(256, 3)! Hi! Hey, listen to this! I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). Some other people liked VAR(258, 5), and I was pretty happy about that. Hey, VAR(256, 3), if you have a chance to come to VAR(292, 0), let's enjoy VAR(296, 10) together. I'm sure it will be fun!
VAR(256, 7): ... ... Huh? What? Sorry, I was spacing out. My hobby. Weeeelll. ...VAR(296, 10), I guess? How about you, VAR(256, 3)? Speaking of hobbies, I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). And I finally found a person with the same hobby. Ha ha! Those things make me happy. I want to trade again, now. VAR(256, 3), let's trade again sometime!
VAR(256, 7): Why, VAR(256, 3)! Hello! Are you here because you've traded Pokémon with people living far away? Hee hee! My Pokémon are cute, but there is a special cuteness about Pokémon you've traded with other people. I've traded Pokémon with people from this many places: VAR(514, 8). I want to trade with still more people. You see, there are lots of people who like VAR(296, 10), too. Talking to Trainers has become quite a bit of fun. Hey, VAR(256, 3). Let's trade again sometime, OK? Promise!
VAR(256, 7): Oh! VAR(256, 3)! Hi! Know what?! Know what?! I've traded Pokémon with people in this many places: VAR(514, 8). Not bad, eh? Hee hee! And I'm going to keep trading! Hm? My hobby? Well... Ummm... VAR(296, 10), I guess! It's fun! Hey, VAR(256, 3), take care of VAR(258, 9). It's very sweet, so be sure to take extra good care of it!

I may walk fast, but I live a slow and relaxing life.
I'm going home early today to have Pokémon battles with my sisters.
Hello! Greeting is important, isn't it?
They say time is money. But when you spend time, you can't get it back.
There are always so many people here...
Even when I loaf, I do it all-out. I am always serious!
This city is a sleepless city... But I need my beauty sleep.
I wish there were shoes that recharge energy by walking!
My big customer must be waiting...
I just keep walking...today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.
Good luck! Me! Good luck! You!
I will watch a baseball game this weekend.
I am having a battle called a job! This is quite tough. That's why it's fun!
Hmmm... It may be a good idea to Dress Up your Pokémon.
Have you had a Pokémon battle with the Gym Leader, Burgh? He's a strange one, but he likes Pokémon very much.
I haven't traveled with my Pokémon for a long time. I feel like doing that...
I will go to the Kanto region for business.
People from different countries gather here in Castelia City.
Everyone is a professional walker!
Even in the crowd of people, don't lose sight of yourself!
Every day, everybody goes their own way.
My business card has a picture of the Pokémon I like best.
I always walk here, so I am good at dodging people.
Argh! You distracted me! I was trying to count all the pedestrians!
Hey, hey, kid! It's dangerous!
Will you become a motorbike rider when you grow up?
The night wind is piercing right through me... My motorbike is freezing, too...
Zowieee!
Wooooo!
Is that so?
Yes.
Huh?
Oh, no!
What's up?
Sorry.
Bye-bye!
Nah.

Hey! Hey, you! What was the first Pokémon you received? ... ... VAR(257, 0)! Really? Then VAR(257, 1) could be a big help!
Your VAR(257, 0) does not do well against VAR(259, 2)-type Pokémon! Say, do you want this VAR(257, 1) of mine?
Oh? You can only have six Pokémon at a time with you, that's all. If you want this Pokémon, you'll have to store one of your others in the PC at the Pokémon Center.
My, my. If you want it, come back and talk to me again, OK?
OK. Here you go! It can use Fire-type moves, so that makes it hot against Grass types!
OK. Here you go! It can use Water-type moves, so that makes it cool against Fire types!
OK. Here you go! It can use Grass-type moves, so that makes it great against Water types!
VAR(256, 0) received VAR(257, 1)!
Give a nickname to the VAR(257, 1) you received?
If you have many types of Pokémon, something will work out, no matter what kind of Pokémon you have to face.
Bianca: Hi, VAR(256, 0)! Are you looking for the mysterious Pokémon, too?
Bianca: I'm just really, really wondering how showing dreams works...
Bianca: Hey! Did you hear a sound coming from the other side of that wall? Come on! Let's go see!
Muuuun...
Bianca: Oh! Wait!
???: We found you, Munna!
???: Come on! Come on! Make some Dream Mist!
Munna: ...Mu!
Bianca: Huh? Who are you?! What are you doing?
???: Are you talking about us? We're Team Plasma. We battle day and night to liberate Pokémon from foolish humans!
Team Plasma: What are we doing? The Pokémon Munna and Musharna emit a mysterious vapor called Dream Mist, which shows people's dreams. We're going to use that to make people want to release their Pokémon... We'll show them dreams to manipulate their hearts.
Munna: Mu... Naa...
Team Plasma: Come on! Spit out that Dream Mist!
Bianca: You're kicking a Pokémon to make it give off Dream Mist? That's mean! Why? You're Trainers too, right?
Team Plasma: That's right. We're Pokémon Trainers too, but we're fighting for a different reason. Unlike you two, we're fighting for the freedom of Pokémon!
Team Plasma: And setting Pokémon free means that we win Pokémon battles and take Pokémon by force! So, on that note, we are going to rescue your Pokémon from you!
Bianca: Whaaat! Don't hurt VAR(256, 0)!
Team Plasma: Were you not taking them seriously because they're kids? Well, whatever, I'm next!
Team Plasma: ...I can't believe we lost! But we have to  obtain the Dream Mist!
Come on! Make with the Dream Mist!
Bianca: Knock it off!
Ghetsis: What are you two doing goofing off?
Ghetsis: We, Team Plasma, shall separate Pokémon from foolish people!
Ghetsis: If you cannot fulfill your duties...
Team Plasma: T-this isn't... Ghetsis when he is gathering followers... Or Ghetsis when he is trying to control people by tricking them with speeches!
Team Plasma: Yeah... This is Ghetsis when a plan has failed, and he is about to issue punishment...
Team Plasma: At any rate, let's hurry and say we're sorry so he forgives us!
???: Shaaar!
Bianca: ...What was that just now? That person called Ghetsis appeared all over the place, and it wasn't real, right?! ...Could it have been a dream?
And that Pokémon...
Oh!
Fennel: I couldn't wait, so I came over! ...Is that Musharna?!
Musharna: Musha?
Munna: Munii!
Fennel: Did something happen?
Bianca: Oh, Fennel. Well, you see, Munna was here... But Team Plasma and Munna... And Musharna came... And it showed us something like a dream? And then, Team Plasma...
Fennel: I think I followed that... See, Musharna evolves from Munna. So, seeing Munna in trouble, it used its power--making dreams into reality--to save Munna. Which means...wait a second!
Is this Dream Mist?!
With this, I can complete my research! You two come to my house later, OK?
Bianca: Phew. How random was that? VAR(256, 0), why don't you go to Fennel's house? Me? Well, I'm going to go look for the Pokémon we saw just now.
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), why don't you go to Fennel's house? Me? Well, I'm going to go look for the Pokémon we saw just now.
Gorm: Boo!
Were you surprised? Oh, Trainer-who-destroyed-our-castle, I was quite surprised by you!
If you surprise them, both Pokémon and people leave themselves open. While they're in a state of surprise, they can't use their powers like they normally would. Our intention was to surprise people by making our castle appear and showing off the legendary Pokémon... At that moment, we planned to deeply impress people's hearts with the awesome power of Team Plasma and the brilliance of our new world.
Now that I've seen the strength of spirit in you and the Gym Leaders, I wonder how effective that strategy would have been, after all. Maybe that strength of spirit is what's needed to take Pokémon to the next level? Hm... I'm sorry to have wasted your time with this silly conversation. Take this with you.
Gorm: My lord N's dream... You were the one who put a stop to that. Please don't ever forget that.
Looker: Ah... And now, about Team Plasma... I am an officer of the International Police, and there are so many things you must tell me at once!
Gorm: Musharna is said to appear here. Its Dream Mist makes you see dreams, but they are nothing but illusions. The dreams you realize with your own abilities are the real dreams.
Looker: Accept my thanks! Now, Ghetsis notwithstanding, there yet remains but VAR(512, 0) of the Seven Sages still at large. What it is they are thinking, what it may be they are hoping, this is the information I pursue. Until we meet again!
Looker: A thousand thanks! Eh, VAR(256, 0)... On a topic I must speak to you. Having received such a report, of someone far from here, who has seen a person like N and...a dragon Pokémon. I am on my way to ascertain the certainty of this information. We will meet again one day!

If you go straight, it doesn't take long. But if you go the wrong way, it's a maze. Is Pinwheel Forest a path or a maze for you?
Burgh: This leads to Pinwheel Forest. If they manage to scuttle off into the forest, we might have trouble.
Yo! Traveling Trainer! Are your Pokémon getting stronger? Here! This might come in handy!
Rock Smash is a move that sometimes reduces your foe's Defense stat. It is super effective against Normal-type Pokémon, which Gym Leader Lenora likes!
It's a challenge rock. Would you like to have VAR(258, 0) smash the rock?
VAR(258, 0) tried to smash the challenge rock. A piece of the rock broke away!
It's a challenge rock.

In order to eliminate the old-fashioned ways of looking at things...
We will steal Pokémon! You'll never play together again!
If their Pokémon are liberated, Trainers will no longer be Trainers!
We are in the right!
Everyone else is wrong!
If you don't think the same way we think, we'll use all our power to eliminate you!
Burgh: Well, you see... There are two ways out of Pinwheel Forest-- the road that goes straight and the path that winds through the woods.
I will take the straight road after them!
If they're not there, I'll block the exit.
Would you please take the other way and check whether Team Plasma is hiding in there somewhere? You'll run into a lot of Trainers, but it's basically a single path, so I'm sure you won't get lost.
Come on! Let's do this for Lenora's sake!
Burgh: Mm-hmm? Team Plasma hasn't come in this direction... The forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.
Burgh: Mm-hmm? Team Plasma hasn't come in this direction... The forest's bug Pokémon are quiet, too.
Team Plasma: You stubborn brat! When I'm through with you, you won't be able to chase us anymore!
Team Plasma: Too bad! I haven't got anything! If you want to get it back, you're just gonna have to look for my associates!
Team Plasma: My, my. Could you be looking for something?
Team Plasma: Sorry! I'm empty handed. Do I look like the kind of girl to carry a heavy load? Better try somewhere else!
Team Plasma: So you made it this far! I'll hold you here so my friends can get away!
Team Plasma: Yep! I'm here to buy time! And if you don't step lively, we're going to get away!
Team Plasma: A pursuer? Uh, ha ha. A kid like you-- beat some of us?! That can't be helped, but... I'll take you on now!
Team Plasma: Fine. Take your stupid skull!
Team Plasma: So the dream our king had-- the dream we had--won't come true...
Gorm: How are you holding up, fellow subject of our king?
Team Plasma: Gorm of the Seven Sages! I'm mortified that this skull, which we went to so much trouble to obtain, was stolen from us so easily.
Gorm: It's not important. We can afford to abandon the Dragon Skull. According to the results of our research, this is not the legendary Pokémon for which Team Plasma is looking. It is completely unrelated.
But we will not allow anyone to disrupt our plans and get away with it. We will fix it so you never interfere with us again.
Burgh: Oh, sweet! The bug Pokémon were getting all worked up, so here I come, and what do I spy with my little eye? This important-looking guy! Are you here to help your friends, whom I defeated?
Lenora: VAR(256, 0)! Burgh! The others didn't have anything... And who are you supposed to be? Is this guy the big boss?
Gorm: I am one of the Seven Sages of Team Plasma. Ghetsis, another of the Seven Sages, will liberate Pokémon with words alone! The remainder of the Seven Sages have ordered their compatriots to take Pokémon with full force! But the odds are a little against us now. To you, the Bug Pokémon user Burgh and the Normal Pokémon user Lenora, I say... Know your enemies, know yourself, and you need not fear the result of a hundred battles... This time, we shall retreat quietly.
To secure the liberation of Pokémon, we will steal Pokémon from Trainers! Even though you are Gym Leaders, we will not tolerate any further obstruction from you. In any case, we will settle this someday. I hope you are looking forward to that time as much as I...
Lenora: They're a speedy bunch. What are you planning to do, Burgh? Are you going to chase them?
Burgh: Hmmm... We got back the stolen skull, and if we corner them, there's no telling what they might do. I think I'll be heading back, Lenora...
Well, now. Well... I'll be waiting for your challenge at Castelia City's Pokémon Gym. Yes, indeed. I'm certainly looking forward to it!
Lenora: VAR(256, 0)! You're holding the Dragon Skull you worked so hard to get back, right?
VAR(256, 0) gave the VAR(265, 1) to Lenora!
Lenora: VAR(256, 0), thank you so much. With a kind Trainer like you taking care of them, the Pokémon with you must be happy. Here is a token of my gratitude. Please use it carefully!
Lenora: This is a Moon Stone! Some Pokémon evolve when you use this item on them. Now, I must take the Dragon Skull back to the museum! See you! Take care of yourself!
I run every day! My goal is to be the marathon champion of the Unova region!
The trees cut on this forest road are sent from Driftveil City to the world.
Have you heard of phytoncides? I don't really understand, but I heard that the reason forests make you feel good is phytoncides!
Hmm... I can feel it... The presence of fierce Pokémon.
The surface is covered with moss. Touching it feels good somehow.
Trainer Tips!  A forest is likely to contain many well-hidden items! They may be hard to find, so look carefully!

Professor Juniper: Hi there, VAR(256, 0)!
I heard about these Pokémon statues, and I came to look into their origins!
I've learned that each of these Pokémon statues is actually a real Pokémon! It's called Darmanitan. It's sleeping, so it's become like a stone.
When I quickly measured how long they've existed... It was amazing! Around 2,500 years! Seems like they went to sleep that long ago. That means they've been here since before this place was in ruins, when the Relic Castle was flourishing. Perhaps they were guarding the city.
These Pokémon... They are either in a state of hibernation or meditation, so if you wake them, they will become active once again. And the item that wakes up Darmanitan is actually...this RageCandyBar! That's why I will share one with you, too, VAR(256, 0)!
Well, I'm headed back to the Pokémon Research Lab. Be seeing you!
It appears to be a statue of a Pokémon.
Give the RageCandyBar to the Pokémon statue?
The ancient Pokémon statue responded to the RageCandyBar. The Pokémon was a sleeping Darmanitan! The awakened Darmanitan attacked!
Cheren: Stop, VAR(256, 0)!
Cheren: That's the entrance to the Relic Castle. You're impressive, VAR(256, 0), making it here before I did.
Dealing with the Desert Resort's Pokémon took longer than I would've thought. I only made it all the way out here thanks to my Pokémon.
Alder went on ahead. Let's hurry.
Cheren: It's hard to put into words... but I'll never forgive them for this!
Alder: What could that guy called N possibly want? Could he be trying to prove he is right by winning the battle of the two dragons?

The Xtransceiver is ringing.
VAR(256, 0) picked up the Xtransceiver.
Alder: I could hear Professor Juniper's voice from clear over here! Seems like something big is happening. I wonder what is waiting at the museum in Nacrene City. I'll go on ahead!
Cheren: I'll look around here once more. I don't want to believe what that Ghetsis says... You should head for the Nacrene City Museum.
I came clear out to the Desert Resort to train, but... There are so many Ground-type Pokémon, and I'm already in tatters...
You're the first person to come clear out here to talk to me! I'm so moved! So, I'll give you this!
If a Pokémon holds this Soft Sand, the power of its Ground-type moves goes up!
According to what I've heard, that Relic Castle is the ruins of a city built by the hero of old and the dragon Pokémon that accompanied the hero.

Oh! A sea of sand! I don't need Go-Goggles here! Oh, I've come here all the way from the Hoenn region.

===============================
Text File: 167
===============================
The Desert Resort is especially known for the Relic Castle.
I'm a School Kid, so I know this! Just like in caves, you can run into Pokémon almost anywhere in the desert. But they don't like hiding in the pale sand. So if you walk there, you won't have to worry about battling.

Oh, you like the Cover Fossil? I heard it is the Fossil of a Pokémon that used to swim in the ancient sea!
Oh, you like the Plume Fossil? It is the Fossil of a bird Pokémon that lived in an ancient forest. ...But they say it couldn't fly.
Oh, won't you please take one? They're really weighing me down.
Oh, did you change your mind? Great! You can have your choice of Fossils!
The museum in Nacrene City... I hear Pokémon can be restored from Fossils there. 'Cause Lenora loves bones and Fossils!

Cheren: Whew! I finally caught up.
Alder: You two. Come here... Come to my side.
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here. It seems you are working hard to resurrect Zekrom, the other Dragon-type Pokémon, aren't you? But it appears the Dark Stone you seek is not here.
Ghetsis: It looks like everyone is here. It seems you are working hard to resurrect Reshiram, the other Dragon-type Pokémon, aren't you? But it appears the Light Stone you seek is not here.
Well then, congratulations are in order! VAR(256, 0), you were chosen by our king. If you truly desire to keep the world as it is, where Pokémon live alongside people, you must bring the other Dragon-type Pokémon spoken of in legend and battle with our king. Otherwise, Team Plasma will steal every Pokémon from every person in the world and release them all!
Alder: Release them, you say? Do the Pokémon who live with their Trainers actually want that? Is the liberation you talk about really just stealing Pokémon from people?
Ghetsis: What's this? Champion Alder, even though illness took the Pokémon that had been your partner for many years, and you haven't had a serious battle in all that time... Even you, who ordered the Elite Four to protect the Pokémon League and left to wander the Unova region alone... Even a Champion like you now wants to protect a world where Pokémon and people live together?
Team Plasma's king will show the people of Unova that he is stronger than a Champion who keeps Pokémon bound! And just like the hero who founded Unova, he will be accompanied by the legendary Pokémon. He will give this order! “Trainers, release your Pokémon!" For this, we have prepared a suitable castle for the legendary Reshiram and our king!

Alder: I won't lose! I'll fight for all Trainers who love their Pokémon, and for all Pokémon who believe in their Trainers!
Ghetsis: Our king has no interest in you. He has already determined that victory against you is assured.
Alder: So you stayed behind just to tell me that? Just to make a fool of me?
Ghetsis: Of course not. I'm doing this out of kindness. Yes, kindness. I'm making sure the Champion doesn't get hurt for no reason. Granted, the moment when someone loses all hope... I really do love to watch that moment. Well then, farewell.
Cheren: Alder... What are you going to do now?
Alder: Hmmm... It seems my only choice is to return to the Pokémon League and battle N. But it bothers me to do exactly what Ghetsis wants... More importantly, what should we do about the Dark Stone?
Alder: Hmmm... It seems my only choice is to return to the Pokémon League and battle N. But it bothers me to do exactly what Ghetsis wants... More importantly, what should we do about the Light Stone?

Alder: Yes...that's a good idea. It's hard to breathe in here!

Ryoku: I was planning to catch the Pokémon called Volcarona that lives in this Relic Castle and present it to Ghetsis. But the Shadow Triad said that Ghetsis has gone somewhere, right?
The Seven Sages... We always said we were complete when the seven of us were together. Now I don't know the meaning of those words anymore. I guess I don't mind, even if we were being used, but the dream is over.
I no longer need this. Ghetsis gave it to me, but I have no use for it.
Ryoku: This Relic Castle and our own castle are both crumbling... But what's different is that this Relic Castle is the remains of a civilization. And our castle left nothing behind...
Looker: Regarding Team Plasma... I am an officer of the International Police, and you must satisfy my request for certain information!
Ryoku: Understood. But we don't know much about Ghetsis or our lord N! We haven't even figured out if they are father and son...
Looker: Accept my thanks! Now, Ghetsis notwithstanding, there yet remains but VAR(512, 0) of the Seven Sages still at large. They are thinking--upon what topics? They are hoping--upon what chances? This is of the utmost urgency. At once! On the way!
Looker: I thank you profoundly! Curiously, VAR(256, 0)... There is a topic on which we must speak. A report has reached my ears of someone far from here. Indeed, this someone has spotted a person like N and a... dragon Pokémon. I depart to validate the validity of this information. We shall meet again, so until then, adieu.

You want to know about this place? This is the Cold Storage. Inside, there are Workers with their Pokémon!
The reason why Clay is having you look for Team Plasma is 'cause he is testing your abilities.
Cheren: VAR(256, 0)... Do you think Team Plasma could be in there? I don't like cold places, but we have to check. What a bother.
Cheren: All right, VAR(256, 0). Let's get this over with.
You can get to the Cold Storage through the gap between the fence and the container over there.
For a few loads, send it by Pokémon. For a lot of loads, send it by ship. Use the best method for your needs!
A helmet is an important tool for shock protection! It's good to let your Pokémon have one, too!
If you let a Pokémon hold a Rocky Helmet, the foe will also be damaged if that foe's move makes physical contact.

Cheren: Well... Still. Is there anything more important than strength for Trainers, like the Champion said?
Oh, I'll never understand just by thinking about it. What a bother. Let's hurry up and check the inside.
Cheren: Oh... Is someone in there?
Shall we go, then?
But the only place in the Cold Storage we haven't searched is here, right?
What's wrong? Aren't you going to check the inside?
When you walk through the containers, some places are frozen, so you go sliding around!

Zinzolin: All of you--huddle around me! I can't take this cold...
Cheren: Whatever. I can't believe you were really hiding. It's a bother, but if you're cold, shall I show you outside?
Zinzolin: Pokémon are our king's friends. While we're taking care of them, we can't let any harm come to them here. Everyone, drive these intruders away!
Team Plasma: Understood, Zinzolin of the Seven Sages! Put 'em up, 'cause here we come!
Cheren: VAR(256, 0)! Let's each take care of one side!
Cheren: VAR(256, 0), you take care of those guys over there!
Team Plasma: I'm one of the tougher members of Team Plasma here!
Team Plasma: How am I supposed to win when I'm shaking 'cause of the cold?
Team Plasma: S-s-so cold... How can I win when I'm shivering so hard?
Team Plasma: For this group, I'm pretty strong. I hope you know that!
Team Plasma: In the middle of the night, we gathered all the Pokémon we stole in front of the container, so we could transport them all at the same time. Then Clay, that old guy, found us. We had been captured!
Team Plasma: In the middle of the night, we gathered all the Pokémon we stole in front of the container, so we could transport them all at the same time. Then Clay, that old guy, found us. We had been captured!

Team Plasma: The Pokémon that work with people may look like they're having fun, but the truth is they're suffering. There's no doubt about it!
Team Plasma: The Pokémon that work with people may look like they're having fun, but the truth is they're suffering. There's no doubt about it!

Team Plasma: Hmm-mmm... I wonder why... I'm getting sleepy for some reason.
Team Plasma: I wonder why... I'm getting sleepy for some reason.

Team Plasma: Um. Running into the Cold Storage, thinking it was a regular container... How cold life can be...
Team Plasma: Me? Losing to a Trainer like this?!
Team Plasma: Achoo! Why did I end up here when I'm allergic to the cold!
Clay: Well, I'll be! Hidin' in a chilly old place like this...
You guys take these Pokémon robbers!
Worker: Roger!
Come on!
Eek!
Ugh!
Clay: You guys ain't so bad! Yup, a promise is a promise. Come on an' challenge my Gym!
Cheren: Whatever... Team Plasma's ideal... Separating people and Pokémon... It's exactly the same as not having Pokémon in this world at all. That bunch is a waste of oxygen. VAR(256, 0)... It's cold, so I'm getting out of here.
Zinzolin: So, you returned? You're an odd Trainer. All right. I've got time enough to satisfy your curiosity.
...Breathing. Having a heart that beats. That is simple existence and nothing more for a living being. That may be the definition of living, but I don't think that defines life.
The experiences of joy and suffering are a vital part of being alive. Ghetsis gave me the sensation of being truly alive... What did he mean to accomplish? That isn't what's important.
Right now, I'm shivering. I'm suffering, but I'm alive.
Pokémon and people live by being together and relying on one another. That might be how you feel. If that's so, is it necessary to separate people and Pokémon? By talking to you, I've discovered that there's much I need to think about... I wish I had more to give you in thanks... Here, take this.
Zinzolin: My lord N said that he wanted to make Pokémon perfect... But, even if the relationship between Pokémon and people stayed as it now is, Pokémon can aspire to perfection...
Looker: Indeed! I am an officer of the International Police, and I demand to hear all you know about Team Plasma!
Zinzolin: It's too cold and I'm already tired of shivering in here. If you'll give me some time to think, I'll tell you what I know. So...take me with you.
Looker: Thanks many times over! Now, Ghetsis notwithstanding, there yet remains but VAR(512, 0) of the Seven Sages still at large. The thoughts they are contemplating, the hopes they are anticipating, these--these are what I want to know! Until our next meeting!
Looker: Thank you! VAR(256, 0), of something we must speak. A report has reached my ears of someone far from here. Indeed, this someone has spotted a person like N and a... dragon Pokémon. I plan to examine the exactitude of this information.  I hope to see you again!

Something that looks like a Pokémon nest is blocking the entrance.
Clay: Thanks fer waitin'.
Looks like th' nest of an Electric-type Pokémon called Galvantula. Don't know why there's a nest here, but if there are folks havin' problems, th' Gym Leader's th' one ta fix it.
Krokorok! Take it out!
And this here TM's yours. It's my favorite TM, so ya can teach it ta all of yer Pokémon!
It's called Bulldoze. This move does damage and lowers the Speed of any Pokémon it hits. Some Ground-type Pokémon move a little slower than ya'd like. If ya use Bulldoze right, ya can cover that weakness!
I don't know how good you really are, but if ya think ya can go, go wherever, and if ya think ya can do somethin', keep doin' it. Do things how ya want! Decide yer own limits.

... My lord N, we brought the one you wanted.
N: VAR(48649, 1)Ah, yes. That was the Shadow Triad, just now. Ghetsis enlisted them in Team Plasma. Apparently, they were the ones who prepared the Galvantula nest at the cave entrance.VAR(48649, 0)
N: VAR(48649, 1)Chargestone Cave... I like this place. Formulas express electricity and its connection to Pokémon... If people did not exist, this would be an ideal place. You have been chosen, you know. Does it surprise you I said that?VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)Of course. Such news should be a surprise.VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)Hmph. If you don't understand what that means, it's not likely to surprise you.VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)I told Ghetsis about you and your friends. After I did, he apparently used the Shadow Triad to find out about you. Cheren is pursuing the ideal of strength. Poor Bianca has faced the sad truth that not everyone can become stronger. And you are not swayed either way-- more of a neutral presence. Which is apparently a good thing. Team Plasma will be waiting for you ahead. Ghetsis wants to see what kind of Pokémon Trainer you really are.VAR(48649, 0)
Heeey!
Guess what!
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), did you know this? The floating stones move when you touch them!
Right, Professor?
Professor Juniper: Hi there! How are you, VAR(256, 0)?
This place is always charged with lots of electricity that Pokémon like! The electric charges react from one stone to another, and that's why some of the stones are floating! But not all of the stones can be pushed.
My father asked me to research Klink, which is a Pokémon that looks like a gear, because I'm researching the origins of Pokémon and the era they appeared. He knows how to get what he wants from people, but I was already interested in this anyway, so it's a lot of fun! Oh, yeah! VAR(256, 0), this is for you!
Professor Juniper: Giving that Lucky Egg to a Pokémon to hold increases the amount of Exp. Points received in battle by a lot! Having strong Pokémon will make it easier to fill your Pokédex pages!
Professor Juniper: VAR(256, 0)! Are you working on your Pokédex? Keep encountering lots of Pokémon, so you can keep filling in those pages!
Bianca: I'm the professor's bodyguard! Well, that's probably not necessary, but you have to protect important things!
Professor Juniper: Hi there! Did you find something? I think we're just about done collecting data.
This cave has been around since the distant past, but... Data to prove that Klink existed more than a hundred years ago can't be found. So that must mean... Klink suddenly appeared a hundred years ago!
Where Pokémon came from and where they are going... If we can learn that, I believe we can get along even better!
Bianca: Know what, VAR(256, 0)? Pokémon are mysterious! I wonder why these amazing little guys stay by our sides.
Where Pokémon came from and where they are going... If we can learn that, I believe we can get along even better!
Bianca: I plan on staying here and catching Pokémon! Traveling is about encounters, you know!
... ...Come.
... There are stairs going down ahead. Team Plasma is waiting for you there.
N: VAR(48649, 1)Many different values mix together, and the world becomes gray... That is unforgivable! I will separate Pokémon and people, and black and white will be clearly distinct! Only then will Pokémon become perfect beings! Yes, that is my dream! That is the dream I must fulfill! VAR(256, 0), do you have a dream of your own?VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)You have a dream... That's wonderful. I'll learn just what kind of dream you have--in battle!VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)As if a person without a dream could ever understand me! Eh... I guess... I have to crush your will here!VAR(48649, 0)

N: VAR(48649, 1)Tsk! Why? Is it impossible for me to win while feeling bad about being a Trainer? As if I could pursue the truth with something as meaningless as a battle! As if that could make me worthy to become friends with the legendary Pokémon!VAR(48649, 0)
N: VAR(48649, 1)Tsk! Why? Is it impossible for me to win while feeling bad about being a Trainer? As if I could pursue my ideals with something as meaningless as a battle! As if that could make me worthy to become friends with the legendary Pokémon!VAR(48649, 0)
Bianca: VAR(256, 0)!
Just a little further to Mistralton City!
Professor Juniper: Bianca, you have good ears. I can't believe you heard VAR(256, 0)'s voice from that far away. VAR(256, 0), who is this Trainer?
N: VAR(48649, 1)Professor Juniper, what are you thinking? You appear to have no qualms about the relationship between Pokémon and people. You put Pokémon into categories using arbitrary rules and think you can understand them like that... The very idea of a Pokédex revolts me. What do you have to say for yourself?VAR(48649, 0)
Professor Juniper: Oh, my. Looks like you're not my biggest fan. Your opinion is understandable. It happens to be different from mine, which is equally understandable. How about if all people get to decide for themselves how to relate to Pokémon?
N: VAR(48649, 1)You're saying I should just allow people to think whatever they want and treat Pokémon however they want, no matter whether the Pokémon suffer? I refuse to tolerate the existence of a world like that!VAR(48649, 0)
Professor Juniper: Well, I didn't expect him to change his mind right away. But I hope he'll spend a little time trying to understand how others feel.
Now, then... I think I'll go collect a little more data. For Pokémon and people to get along better, we need to take steps to learn more about them!
Bianca: Umm, VAR(256, 0)! I'm gonna go with Professor Juniper now 'cause I'm her bodyguard!

Team Plasma: This kid is the real thing!
Team Plasma: Because of you, I'm now ex-Team Plasma. Being an ex doesn't sound cool, does it? How are you going to make it up to me?
Team Plasma: An ex-Team Plasma member becomes an ordinary Pokémon Trainer... This was that moment.
Bronius: The Pokémon of our Team Plasma are also fighting for their Trainers. It was so obvious that I overlooked it... Thank you for reminding me of that. Here, I'd like you to take this.
Bronius: Pokémon do their best for their Trainers even when they are injured. I wonder whether my lord N understands what that means?
Looker: On the topic of Team Plasma... I am an officer of the International Police, so you would be wise to share all you know.
Bronius: Those who left Team Plasma and are behaving with respect and understanding toward Pokémon... Them, please forgive! However, those who won't interact with Pokémon in a kind and honest way... Even I will never forgive them!
Looker: Truly, I thank you! Now, Ghetsis notwithstanding, there yet remains but VAR(512, 0) of the Seven Sages still at large. Their innermost thoughts, their uttermost hopes... These I must and shall discover! Once more, a brief farewell!

Cheren: If it isn't the Champion, Alder. I'm weak, so I lost! ...And, honestly, it bothers me when you call it a fine battle despite that.
Alder: Oh, honestly, Cheren. Just accept the compliment without the stinging remark. I've asked you this before, but what do you plan to do after becoming strong?
Cheren: If I get strong and become a Champion, that will be the reason for my existence. I want to prove that I'm really living.
Alder: Hmmm... You remind me of Marshal. Of course, having something you want to become is important. But what is even more important is what you do with your newfound power. Anyway, take this!
Here--you, too.
Alder: If you use the move Surf, you can travel over water. I shall see you again, young Trainers. Don't forget about the needs of the Pokémon at your side!
Cheren: What I do with my power... I don't know that answer yet. First, I want to become a strong Trainer so everyone will acknowledge that power!

Get this! Team Plasma has obtained the power to change this world and end people's control over Pokémon.
Team Plasma: That's right! We must use force in order to right the wrongs of the world. Now, let's gather around our king. Our lord N!

Bianca: Professor, what's the Dragonspiral Tower?
Cedric: Ha! I guess you would be curious. Well, I'll explain briefly. Dragonspiral Tower has stood tall since long before Unova was founded. On the top floor, the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon waits for a person seeking truth to appear... That's what is said.
Cedric: Ha! I guess you would be curious. Well, I'll explain briefly. Dragonspiral Tower has stood tall since long before Unova was founded. On the top floor, the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon waits for a person pursuing ideals to appear... That's what is said.
Are you going to go after Team Plasma like your friend did? It's admirable of you to join the fight against Team Plasma, but it's risky, too.
Bianca: Don't worry! VAR(256, 0) and Cheren are both really, really strong, and they've beaten Team Plasma before. But...I'm not all that strong, actually. I admit it. I'm not very strong, so I was thinking... It would be nice if, maybe, I could... Stay here and be your bodyguard?
Cedric: Why, thank you! That makes me feel much safer! Well, VAR(256, 0)! It's up to you! Climb the tower!


This is all I can give you, but it might help you rest!
Cedric: Still... What could Team Plasma be after?
Cedric: Still... What could Team Plasma be after?
Bianca: VAR(256, 0)... Please don't do anything crazy.











Cedric: Astounding... I never would have imagined the legendary Dragon-type Pokémon would return now...
Cheren: That guy called N... Team Plasma's boss apparently reawakened the legendary Pokémon. He told VAR(256, 0) to look for the other legendary Pokémon, then flew away...
Bianca: Huh? There are two legendary Dragon-type Pokémon?
???: Yes! Yes, there are!
Cedric: Why, if it isn't Alder! It's been a while! Have you been well?

Alder: No time for chitchat! That fearsome column of fire that shot from the tower... That Pokémon has the power to destroy the world! If it's on Team Plasma's side, and Team Plasma tells everyone to release their Pokémon... No matter whether it comes from fear or admiration... The world can't help but change. It will become a world where we are separated from Pokémon...
Alder: No time for chitchat! Those violent flashes of lightning that shot from the tower... That Pokémon has the power to destroy the world! If it's on Team Plasma's side, and Team Plasma tells everyone to release their Pokémon... No matter whether it comes from fear or admiration... The world can't help but change. It will become a world where we are separated from Pokémon...
Cedric: Right... Moreover, the boss of Team Plasma, N, who reawakened Reshiram, apparently said to look for the other Pokémon, Zekrom.
Cedric: Right... Moreover, the boss of Team Plasma, N, who reawakened Zekrom, apparently said to look for the other Pokémon, Reshiram.
Alder: If I remember the myth, Reshiram's fiery breath, along with the other Pokémon, devastated ancient Unova in an instant. Even knowing that, N is still wanting to awaken the other?!
Alder: If I remember the myth, Zekrom's powerful electricity, along with the other Pokémon, devastated ancient Unova in an instant. Even knowing that, N is still wanting to awaken the other?!
Bianca: H-huh?! Isn't it dangerous to bring back a Pokémon that powerful?
Alder: Miss, you are a very kind person. Still, I don't know if other Pokémon will be able to stand up to it. Because, no matter what, it is a legendary being... I don't like the idea of taking orders from N, but searching for the dragon-- the stone--might not be a bad plan. We certainly can't let Team Plasma reawaken both of them! Since I've traveled all over Unova, I have an idea of where it might be. Let's head to the Relic Castle. VAR(256, 0), everyone, I'm going!
Cedric: I see. We'll leave that to you. I'm going to investigate inside the tower. Hopefully, I'll find something.
Brycen: Then, I will go with you.
Cheren: I think I understand better now. Being able to do something for Pokémon-- for somebody at a time like this--is strength... I'm sure of it. And my strength is something that is given to me by Pokémon. OK, Champion, let's hurry!
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), this has turned into a big deal. So confusing... I dunno what to do... Are you gonna go to the Relic Castle, VAR(256, 0)? Past Route 4, in the Desert Resort... I hear that's where the Relic Castle is...
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), look for the Desert Resort past Route 4. I hear that's where the Relic Castle is...

Cedric: Maybe I should have my daughter look into when this tower was built. If you want someone to investigate the origin of Pokémon, she's the best.
Brycen: So, this is Dragonspiral Tower. There's a certain heaviness to the air. Did Reshiram, who woke up here, see something in N?

Team Plasma: So this is the true strength of a Gym Leader!
Team Plasma: This strength... Could it be equal to the Seven Sages?
Team Plasma: No one! I won't let anyone get in our way!
Team Plasma: Why do you get in our way even though you don't understand our sublime goal?!
Team Plasma: So young, but so tough!

Cheren: ...Marshal?
Marshal: My mentor told me you were here, so I came to see. Listen. Even if you lose in battle, if you surpass what you've done before, you have bested yourself. Take the opportunity of a battle to look at your opponent, look at the Pokémon involved, and look at yourself!
Cheren: Are those Alder's words?
Marshal: Maybe. But I'm borrowing them. What I want are battles with Trainers who believe in themselves like that... When I mix it up with a Trainer like that, both my Pokémon and I get even stronger. Well then, I'll be waiting for your challenge in the Pokémon League.

We are just about to leave, so please get on board and wait a moment.

The smell of the ocean is so soothing!
Waaah! I'm scared!
You sure took care of those bad guys, mister!
You sure took care of those bad guys, miss!
Making my grandchild cry! If they are underestimating me because I'm old... Grrr!
Thank you very much for saving my grandchild.
Shut your trap! If you stay here quietly, we won't be rough.
What do they hope to accomplish by occupying the island? What a sketchy group!
If I had known this island's secret earlier, I would've... What? No! Nothing! Just talking to myself!
What are they doing in this little memorial park? There's nothing here but an old lighthouse...
Too many people use Pokémon for bad deeds!
This officer's Pokémon couldn't stand up to them! That blasted Team Plasma!
I'm really glad a strong Trainer like you is around!
Recently, I've been bored because the number of tourists has decreased.
Two hundred years ago, an ultra-rich family bought this island and named it Liberty Garden. It's a place where people and Pokémon could live freely.
Dock 2 To board the tour boat, go to Dock 1.
This lighthouse shines with the light of freedom. Only authorized personnel may enter.
My fellow officers rushed here by police boat! Thanks to them, we rounded up these baddies!
How's that Pokémon doing? The island sure has been quiet since that incident.
Team Plasma forever!
We won't give up!
You're irredeemable!
Get moving!
Professor Juniper: Thanks to you, VAR(256, 0), this group that was up to no good has been captured!
Victini is a mythical Pokémon that is said to radiate energy from its body... When Pokémon or people come into contact with that energy, it fills up their bodies, and they exhibit more power than usual. That's why there was no end to the people who wanted to use Victini for their own evil ends... I'm sure the rich person who built this underground room for Victini was sincerely trying to help it. But I think shutting the poor thing up in this room was a mistake. Thanks to you, Victini has a new destiny that does not involve being used in Team Plasma's schemes. Making sure no one misuses Victini's powers is now your duty!
Also... In the Unova Pokédex, Victini was assigned a special number: zero. I've heard the special number was assigned in the hope that Victini's power to bring victory would be shared with the Trainer who travels with this Pokédex...
Professor Juniper! We cornered the crooks with our high-speed police boat! We will return to Castelia City! Please come on board, too!
Professor Juniper: Thank you! I'll be right there!
I can't believe it when people are led astray by Pokémon's astounding abilities and try to misuse them... But it's only when we face Pokémon with a good heart that we can make a brighter future!

The one who obtains this Pokémon is said to be victorious in any type of competition... We can obtain a power that would make us invincible! That is the value of this mythical Pokémon, Victini!
This is a secret room meant to hide Victini! Two hundred years ago, a certain rich person bought this entire island and hid Victini in this underground room. After that, no one saw Victini, and it became a mythical Pokémon...
We, Team Plasma, will liberate Victini from this room and use its powers to make our goal a reality! We won't let a brat like you get in our way!
It looks like I underestimated your strength. But Victini won't be so simple! Look!
Looks like it's waiting to test your strength. You'd better get ready!
Living with Victini means accepting Victini's cruel destiny... Someday we will test you to see if you are truly ready for that.
Victini is still close by and watching your movements... If you exit this room and come back, it might return...
Ta-ta-ta-tah!
Victini vanished from the underground room...

Oh, it's just a kid...
You... It couldn't be... The fact that you are here means you came to learn about the secret of Genesect!
We, Team Plasma, revived Genesect from a Fossil. Then we enhanced the Pokémon with the power of science!
It is the strongest Pokémon in history!!
But, our lord N was not interested in this Genesect that was modified by the power of science!
“Science damages the natural beauty of Pokémon! They're perfect beings!"
That's what he said... So our research was halted, and this facility was closed...
However!! The Genesect research is all mine! So if you want to know Genesect's secret, you'll have to beat me in battle!
Battle the Scientist?
I've lost everything... I forgot my duty as a Scientist is to make the world happy. So, this must be what I get for trying to make a Pokémon into a tool for fighting...
I'm going to wash my hands of this Genesect matter... I don't need this anymore... I'll give it to you.
There was another one in my other pocket...
The item I just gave you was made for Genesect. When it holds an item like this, it changes the type of the move called Techno Blast, so it can always have an advantage.
There sure are some very cowardly Trainers, aren't there!
So you want to battle me?!
I've given you all of the Drives. Use them how you wish...
There is a memo stuck to the side of the monitor. Read it?
My lord N apparently rejected my research... But my research is necessary for Team Plasma to reach its goal... The strongest Pokémon... The rest of the memo is torn and impossible to read.

Hello! If you cross the Skyarrow Bridge from here, you'll reach Castelia City.
In battles, striking first is essential! So, here!
If you give it to a Pokémon to hold, maybe it will let that Pokémon use its move before its opponent can. That's what I gave you. It's called Quick Claw!
There are people who are obsessed with certain items. They'll even buy your items for a lot of money! You might even be able to sell items you can't use to these people, so maybe you should hang on to them.

Sometimes, above the bridge, you can see the shadows of bird Pokémon, right? Their feathers drift to the ground here! And when you try to pick them up, occasionally, you'll run into a Pokémon.
When a ship passes, the bridge raises and lowers. But Clay controls when the ships run from the start, so when the bridge raises and lowers is up to Clay.
When Driftveil is mentioned, what comes to mind is the Cold Storage... and Charles!

It is my lord N's thought that the two holders of the legendary Pokémon should put their beliefs on the line and strive to find which is the true hero.
This is not necessary, however. From his infancy, I provided him with the education required to become the hero of legend. Indeed, he has been so acknowledged by the legendary Pokémon. ...Such purity of purpose is his.
The liberation of Pokémon of which I... Of which Team Plasma speaks is the separation of Pokémon from foolish people! That's the truth! All Trainers will become helpless to resist us! We alone will be able to use Pokémon!
The preparations are complete! When my perfect plan is set in motion, first a few gullible Pokémon Trainers who are unable to resist Team Plasma will release their Pokémon. Then that number will become a hundred, then a thousand... In no time, even the Gym Leaders and the Champion will become unable to fight us. Having a Pokémon will be considered a bad thing! Even people like the sad little Bianca, whose Pokémon was stolen in Castelia, will be unable to face public opinion and will release their Pokémon! That's the kind of world we'll make!
You may have the Stone, but there's no chance whatsoever that the legendary Pokémon will accept you as the hero. So, if you're not willing to hand over your precious Pokémon, I suggest you search for some courage-- because you're going to need it!
When I was running around trying to outrun the trains, I got overheated. Phew! Anyway, please take this!
This TM contains Flame Charge! If the move lands, the user's Speed goes up! You'll blow by everyone!
Hey, you! It's just my opinion, but it's best if you avoid this area on weekend evenings. The brats who live around here often get up to something stupid.
Hey! Who said ya can pass through here? When Friday night rolls around, this place belongs to us, the Black VAR(257, 0)! It's like our Gym, kid! So scram! Toddle off home to your ma, ya perfect little goody-two-shoes punk!
What didja say, ya little creep? I'll teach ya to take the Black VAR(257, 0) seriously! I'll pummel your pretty Pokémon right down to the ground! With relish!
Ha! Fine! Brats like you with a future so bright... Just go on back home and be nice to your parents. Don't forget your baby bottle!
Ha! Fine! Brats like you with a future so bright... Just go on back home and be nice to your parents. Don't forget your baby bottle!

Don't get all feeling good because you beat me! If you really want to start a fight with the Black VAR(257, 0), go duke it out with our leader! He's somewhere on this bridge!
Hey! Yeah, you, the little brat there! Get over here!
What do you think you're up to, brat? This is the Black VAR(257, 0)'s ultimate paradise... A little pest like you has no business here... It couldn't be that you think you can stand up to me, the head of the Black VAR(257, 0)?
Gwa ha ha ha! Bring it! You've got your share of guts, kid! I'll show you what the guy who holds the Black VAR(257, 0) together can really do!
That all you got? Nah, you got one option left--get lost! This is our place, the Black VAR(257, 0). We got no place else to go, and we don't want nobody gettin' in our way.
You ain't half bad, kid... I like ya. Get a load of this...  From now on, our team's name is gonna be the Black VAR(257, 0)! Yeah! We're taking the name of your rough-and-tough Pokémon! It's a wilder name for a wilder team! The Black VAR(257, 0)! Gwa ha ha ha! That's awesome!
The Black VAR(257, 0)! Speed's our only friend!
The Black VAR(257, 0)! At a breakneck pace until dawn breaks!
The Black VAR(257, 0)! Never stop, and never look back!

During the day, I sunbathe. During the night, I moonbathe... Nature sinks into my body.

I will cross all the bridges in Unova!

Derleth: What is piercing my mind is a sad sound. What is piercing my heart is a cold night wind.
Derleth: Fwee... Fwee... Fffweeet fweet...
Derleth: The only things that come out of my mouth are my whistle tunes and complaints about my life. This bridge is a meeting place for people like me who like to complain.
Aickman: How about this? This sound! Doesn't it get to your heart? Your mind?
Aickman: I know my sound doesn't fit this city, this town. But I... I cannot change my life, my style.
Aickman: This is my best friend, my pal. It knows all my sorrow, all my tears.

Wahaha. Isn't this a beautiful bridge? This old bridge was built when my great-great-great-grandfather was around.
My grandpa is a stonecutter for Village Bridge!
Isn't this a unique sort of bridge? A long time ago, the river overflowed, and all the houses were washed away. So people built new houses on top of the bridge to keep them safe from flooding! It's a simple solution, but it's genius!

This is a very old bridge, but thanks to the elderly man next door who takes care of it, the bridge always looks its best!
Village Bridge is the oldest bridge in Unova. It says so right here in my book! I heard it was built 200 years ago!

Oh! A Trainer! Let me introduce myself. I am a member of the Hip Waders. As its name suggests, it's a fishing club! Why don't you join up and enjoy some fishing?
Hey, Trainer! Why don't you join the Hip Waders and do some fishing?
That's the way the tide turns, huh? But, I won't give up. If you change your mind, come see me again!
Awesome! Now you are the second member of the Hip Waders!
Here we go! I'll announce the Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day! The Pokémon we're fishing for today is VAR(257, 0)! If you catch one, please show it to me!
The Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day is VAR(257, 0)! Have you caught one already?
That's great! Show it to me!
Oh! This is a great VAR(257, 0)! That's why you're the second member of the Hip Waders! Cool! Take these with you!
Oh! This is a great VAR(257, 0)! ...But when it comes to the Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day, a Pokémon you caught before today doesn't count. Sorry!
Oh! This is a great VAR(257, 0)! But it's not the Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day. Sorry!
The Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day is VAR(257, 0)! I'm counting on you, Member No. 2!
The appeal of fishing... That's something you have to discover through experience, rather than listening to me explaining about it! Right, Member No. 2?
Yo! Member No. 2! Times have changed... That's right! Because today is a new day, we've got a new Official Hip Waders Catch of the Day! Isn't it exciting?

Ghetsis is gone. He went off somewhere alone after we rescued him from the castle.
From the day Ghetsis saved our lives, we have sworn to be loyal to him. Even now, after he ordered us not to search for him.
Also, Ghetsis said to give you this...
As well as this...
And this, also.
Ghetsis... Where did he find these? What was he planning to do with them? Why did he give them to you? There's no way to know now. Is he testing you? Or...using you?
We, the Shadow Triad, have always been and will always be the loyal servants of Ghetsis. And Ghetsis's ambitions will never cease!
Never shall we meet again. Farewell!
Will you come see the famous Patrat show at Marvelous Bridge?
OK! I'm going to get all fired up!
Oh... I'm confident you will be greatly entertained, so come again sometime!
Ready all Patrat! Everyone gather up!
The Patrat that I will have you follow today is...
This--the li'l Patrat with the brightest smile! It's holding a VAR(265, 0)! Ready, set, go!
This--the li'l Patrat with the cutest dimples! It's holding a VAR(265, 0)! Ready, set, go!
This--the li'l Patrat with the trendiest eyebrows! It's holding a VAR(265, 0)! Ready, set, go!
This--the li'l Patrat with the biggest belly! It's holding a VAR(265, 0)! Ready, set, go!
OK! Find the Patrat that I asked you to follow!
That Patrat is holding a VAR(265, 0), right?
You are... ... ... ... totally correct! Receive your prize, a VAR(265, 0), from that Patrat!
You are... ... ... ... inconceivably incorrect! I'm sorry...
That marks the grand finale of our Patrat show! Thank you, one and all!
You want to see the Patrat again? There are a lot of preparations and such to make, so come back tomorrow!

How is your Pokédex coming along? Can I see it?
Let me see... Oh, you've seen VAR(514, 0) Pokémon in the Unova region!
Let me see... Oh, you've caught VAR(514, 0) Pokémon in the Unova region!
This Pokédex is full of memories from your journey. It's a treasure you can cherish for your entire life.
If you want to meet more Pokémon, you should try walking through tall grass!
It seems a little more like a Pokédex now! You're getting off to a good start!
Some Pokémon are hard to find, but don't give up! Keep checking the tall grass.
Some Pokémon are only found in certain caves! You might want to go back and search caves you've already passed through.
Trainers have a lot of different Pokémon. So battling them is a great way to fill up your Pokédex, too!
Wow, it's getting really full! I'm sure looking over your Pokédex will bring back memories of your journey.
Over 100 Pokémon... It's so much fun looking over all their different characteristics!
That is an excellent Pokédex! Just a little more and it will be full!
What a wonderful Pokédex! A little more work, and it'll be complete! I'm really glad I asked you to do this!
Amazing! Truly amazing! You've met all of the Pokémon in the Unova region! Congratulations! Now here's your next challenge: see how many of those Pokémon you can catch! I'll keep evaluating for you!
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at a good clip! I have something I want to give you! Please come to the lab when you can.
It seems like you are meeting Pokémon at a good clip! Here! This is a gift to thank you for all your hard work!
False Swipe is a move that is very helpful for catching Pokémon, because it keeps the target from fainting!
Protect is a move that completely prevents an attack from hitting! Well, there are a few exceptions. Some moves, like Feint, can still hit even if Protect is used.
Hidden Power is a mysterious move. Its type and power change depending on the Pokémon that learns it!
Try using this, too!
Keep up the good work!
Little by little, more detailed information is being entered into the Pokédex! Do your best!
Are you trying out different kinds of Poké Balls for your captures? They come in lots of varieties, so be sure to use the right one at the right time!
If you read the Pokédex descriptions, you can learn a lot of unexpected facts about Pokémon! It's fun!
Evolving Pokémon is another important way to fill up your Pokédex. It's not just about catching them!
Trading Pokémon with friends also counts as catching them!
When you've met this many Pokémon, do you have trouble picking which ones to travel with?
This is a very thorough Pokédex. It will help my research, too!
You've caught so many Pokémon. You might know more than me now! I'm rooting for you to complete your Pokédex!
With just a little more effort, you will complete a perfect Pokédex! You've come this far, so do your best!
Amazing! Absolutely amazing! You've caught every Pokémon in the Unova region! Congratulations!!
So you're here to show me how your Pokédex is coming along, right?
I see! You've caught VAR(514, 0) Pokémon, then...
Oh, really... If you want me to have a look at your Pokédex, come here again!
Nationally, there are more than 600 Pokémon! You'll have to be persistent and catch them at your own pace.
First, you might want to revisit places you've already been. Retrace your steps in the Unova region and see what new Pokémon turn up!
Remember Rule No. 1! To catch a Pokémon, you first have to reduce its HP. You're pretty good at this now, but don't forget the basics!
Are you going to the Day Care? I've heard that some Pokémon can only be caught if they are hatched from Eggs.
Do you have a fishing rod? There are many Pokémon that live in the water. Try searching rivers and oceans!
Do you know the move False Swipe? False Swipe always leaves a tiny bit of the targeted Pokémon's HP. It's great for catching, because it doesn't make them faint!
Do you know the move Mean Look? If you use Mean Look on a Pokémon, it can't run away!
There are several ways for Pokémon to evolve. Some Pokémon even evolve through friendship!
Have you heard of mass outbreaks? Big groups of Pokémon appear during a mass outbreak. It's a great chance to catch them!
You've caught more than 400 different Pokémon?! That's incredible! You're an amazing Trainer!
Apparently, some Pokémon evolve when they are leveled up in a certain area.
You've caught 500 different Pokémon... My, the variation of these beings called Pokémon certainly is surprising! And the fact that you've caught so many different kinds... That's pretty surprising, too!
Have you been to the Poké Transfer Lab on Route 15? Mastering a facility like that is an accomplishment for a Pokémon Trainer.
Just a little more until you complete your Pokédex, huh? Catching this many Pokémon must mean... You really like Pokémon, don't you!
Oh! That's a wonderful Pokédex. How about it? Would you research Pokémon with me?
Oh! Just a little more until your Pokédex is complete! Make sure you go after the roaming Pokémon and trade with friends to get the ones you're missing!
... ... This blows me away! It's so wonderful, I'm at a loss for words. You... You've accomplished something truly outstanding. Filling up the National Pokédex makes you a Trainer among Trainers! I'm so happy I was able to meet a fantastic Trainer like you! I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

If you'd like, I could judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon.

I see, I see... This Pokémon has relatively superior potential overall. That's my determination, and it's final.

Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its HP.

Incidentally, I would say the best potential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.

Its Sp. Atk stat is equally good.
Its Sp. Def stat is good as well.
Well, its Speed stat is also good.

Participate in the musical?

Welcome to the Pokémon Musical! This is a changing room for Dress Up only. Would you like to Dress Up your Pokémon?
This way, please!
Would you like to Dress Up your Pokémon?
What would you like me to explain?
What's the Pokémon Musical?
The Pokémon Musical is a show where Pokémon wearing Props perform on stage. Anyone can participate! We encourage all Trainers to show the world how charming their Pokémon are! The audience is looking forward to seeing how you Dress Up your Pokémon, and how your Pokémon perform!
How to Participate
You can join the musical from any of the three reception areas. The reception area in the center is for participating alone. When you participate alone, you will be joined by other Trainers from around the Unova region. If you want to put on a musical with your friends, go to the left reception area. You'll be asked to pick a Leader who will choose which show to perform, and the others will join the group. The reception area to the right is where you go to Dress Up only.
Eligible Pokémon
The Pokémon that will participate in the musical are chosen from your party at the reception area. Because of their shape, some Pokémon have a hard time wearing certain Props. You might want to try Dress Up in the changing room first if you're worried!
Dress Up
Oh, Dress Up is my favorite part! That's where you put the Props you've collected on the Pokémon that will be performing. Depending on the Pokémon, you can put the Props in different places. When you use Props that fit the theme of the show you've chosen, the audience will notice your Pokémon more! Sometimes a Prop that doesn't fit the theme will also make your Pokémon stand out. If you want to get an idea of how it's done, you can watch how other people Dress Up and then try it yourself!
Shows
You can choose which show to perform when you participate in the musical. There is no need for Trainers to give commands, but if your Pokémon is carrying a Prop in its arms, it can use that Prop to show off and appeal to the audience. Depending on how you Dress Up your Pokémon, the reactions from the audience will change!

In this castle, you may rest your Pokémon and access your PC. Fear not.

Our lord N proved that he is stronger than the Champion! Now many Trainers will admire our lord N and follow his orders! In other words, they will do whatever Team Plasma says!

I am Anthea... Trainer. Before you go to confront my lord N, please take a moment to rest...
Ah, good. Both you and your Pokémon regained energy... Trainers battle to practice their skills and to grow in experience, but never to hurt their Pokémon. My lord N has realized this, deep down in his heart...but he has spent too much painful time here in this castle to admit it...

I am Concordia. I give peace and comfort to N. N has been separated from people since he was young. He was brought up with Pokémon... Pokémon that were betrayed, mistreated and hurt by bad people... Ghetsis deliberately brought only those poor Pokémon closer to N. N was touched by their plight, and started pursuing the truth, thinking only of Pokémon. N's heart is pure and innocent. But there is nothing more beautiful and terrifying than innocence.

Will you go to the Pokémon League?
Go!
I see.
I don't need an item to catch Pokémon anymore...
Poké Balls... From my point of view, they are items that keep Pokémon confined. But for Trainers like you, they are a way to bond with Pokémon... If you run out of Poké Balls, come see me. I will give one to you.
You need a Poké Ball? OK. Take this.

Ghetsis: Welcome, holder of the Dark Stone.
Ghetsis: Welcome, holder of the Light Stone.
The castle that appeared as if it were enveloping the Pokémon League is a symbol. It means Unova will change.
The king of this castle is the strongest Trainer in the world. He is accompanied by the legendary Pokémon. He has defeated the Champion. Added to all that, his heart burns with the desire to improve the world. If that's not what makes a hero, what more do you need?
Now that the stage is set, we can seize people's minds and hearts. We can bring into being the world that I--no, that Team Plasma--desires more easily than you can imagine! We and only we will use Pokémon, and we shall rule the powerless populace!
I've been waiting so long for this! I've kept my silence so no one could piece together what I planned. Now, those painful days are at an end!
Go! Onward!
Discover whether you have what it takes to be a hero!
Ghetsis: Go! Holder of the Dark Stone! In this room, you can learn whether you, too, can be a hero!

Cheren: Rule the world?? Wasn't Team Plasma's goal to liberate Pokémon?
Ghetsis: That was just a convenient lie that I needed to create Team Plasma. Use your head. What's to be gained from letting go of useful things like Pokémon? Certainly, manipulating Pokémon helps people expand their possibilities. That much, I can agree with. So it naturally follows that only I should be able to use Pokémon!

The power stored in this tree is called Pass Power. You can register only one Pass Power in your C-Gear. You use it by aiming at people you pass by with the Tag Log. But you need a Pass Orb to use Pass Power. Carry out a mission in someone else's world and collect Pass Orbs.

Oh, someone showed up... Welcome to the Entralink. Hm? Judging by the look of you, you don't seem to know where you are.
This is an island called the Entralink. It's located in the center of the Unova region. The Entralink is a mysterious place where you can connect with someone's world. If you go to someone's world by passing through this island, you will be able to meet an adventurer in the world.
And you can help that adventurer. Yes! If you want to help, cross a bridge in this island and go to someone's world. There must be someone who is waiting for you there!
This bridge will connect to someone else's world.
Is there anything you'd like to know about a connection at a bridge?
When you are on a bridge, a search will start to find a person to connect with. If the bridge connects, you will be able to cross into that person's world.
This bridge will connect to the world of a person who is having an adventurous journey in a town or on a road around the Entralink. If you cross the bridge, you will be able to help with that person's adventure.
Now, please go to the bridge. If it connects to someone else's world, you'll be able to cross.

Pokémon that your Pokémon met in its dream will show up in the Entralink in a Forest Clearing. Pokémon in a Forest Clearing will be your friends for sure! If you move the Pokémon to the Deepest Clearing, they will wait for you there.
When your Pokémon wakes up from a dream, please come to this forest.

Oooooh! You've received a Pass Power! It's wonderful! Really wonderful! Pass Power can help people who passed by. Check the Tag Log in your C-Gear later. ...Well, that's really all I can teach you.

Hey, le Trainer fantastique! Want to be part of the experiment of the century? You need two DS systems to play with Poké Transfer! Do you have a second DS system that you can use?
If you decide that you want to play with Poké Transfer sometime, you're welcome to come back and ask me.
I'm sorry! Sumimasen! But you don't have enough space in your PC Box. Please make room for six Pokémon and try again.
OK! But just remember! ¡Muy importante! Once you bring a Pokémon here, you can't send it back. Do you still want to do it?
DS Wireless Communications will be launched.

OK, OK. Come here. Stand right there!
Well, let's begin! Allons-y!
Great! Molto bene!
You're just as skillful as I expected! Poké Transfer is working! But hey, VAR(256, 0), you can't fool me! I bet you can do even better than this. A Trainer of your caliber can make really good use of Poké Transfer!
Wunderbar! Magnifique! Brilliant! Your skill is impressive! This is the very reason why we scientists are doing research! But, VAR(256, 0)! I think a Trainer with your experience can make use of it even more elegantly. Please master your genius handling of Poké Transfer, and show us how it's done!
Great! Greeeeeeat! Poké Transfer is making tremendous progress! Well, it's unbelievable! ¡Es gigante! I owe everything to you! Please assist our research in the future, too! Please feel free to use Poké Transfer anytime you want!
... G... Great! Greeeat! F--a--n--t--a--s--t--i--c! Your handling of Poké Transfer is reeeally exhilarating! Ohhhh, our invention is near completion! Come again very soon! Come again immediately! And please show us even more wonderful handling of Poké Transfer!
Ohhhhhhhh. Any moment! Any moment! Poké Transfer is only one step away from going down in history as a fantastic invention!
VAR(256, 0)! As I thought, my instinct was right... You are a prodigy! A genius! There won't be anyone else who can handle Poké Transfer in such a professional manner. Please use Poké Transfer anytime you want in the future! We will be here any time to continue to do further research! If you want to use Poké Transfer, please let us know!
I put the Pokémon you caught in your PC Box.
But, it seems you could not catch any Pokémon.
Ugh... There seems to be a communication error. I'm afraid you have to try it again!
Hi, hello! You came here. That means you are a visitor? Huh? No? You came all the way here? Ah, you are a Trainer? Are you in the middle of your journey? Ah, this is your Trainer Card?
W-w-what? You! You have all the Gym Badges?!
Great! You may be able to...
Professor Paaaaaark!
Quick, quick!
Oh, there you are!
Professor! Do you have a minute? I think you do. Listen! This kid is a Trainer who has all the Gym Badges. All of them! I am sure this Trainer can operate it!
I have told you many times. This invention is great indeed, but without a professional Trainer...
What? You have the Gym Badges? ALL of them?!
Fantastic! Fantastico!
Yahoooooooooooooooo!
What a great day! Great! Unbelievable! Hi, I am Professor Andrew Park! You! Er...
VAR(256, 0)!
VAR(256, 0)! Are you willing to participate in an ambitious experiment that will make history? This device is called Poké Transfer. It connects...blah blah blah... ...called DS system...meanwhile... ...blah blah...of molecules...and then... ...while evoking...blah blah... ...ergo, energy particles will... ...blah blah...and if the frequency... ...as you see...with faraway Pokémon... ...the Alpha waves...blah blah... ...following which...reach convergence... ...blah blah...spectacular results!
To put it more simply, if you use this device, you may be able to bring Pokémon here from other regions. But just for safety's sake, the Pokémon you're transferring shouldn't be holding anything! So make sure to take their items first.
...So! You!
You are a fantastic Pokémon Trainer! Will you participate in the great experiment of the century? You need two DS systems to use Poké Transfer! We will conduct the experiment with another DS. Is that OK?
Your Pokémon can't be holding items when you transfer them. It's safer that way. In rare cases, there are Pokémon that cannot be transferred, but Professor Park will explain it to you.
With this research of mine, I also want to have an impact on people in the future... people living 100 or 200 years from now!
Here, we are monitoring Poké Transfer. We're keeping a careful eye to make sure all the Pokémon have safe travels!

My name is Loblolly. I'm a designer of Décor items. But I'm stuck now... I just can't come up with a good design. I've been thinking about Décor so great that it will appear in a dream...
Loblolly: Hmmm... I still can't think of a great new Décor item. Will you come back again?
Loblolly: When I come up with some good designs, please help me again!
Loblolly: I finally came up with some new designs. I'm really proud of them! But I'd like your opinion! Look at these Décor items and tell me which one you'd dream about!
I think I've finally designed Décor items so great that people will dream about them! Here! Which one would you dream about?
Loblolly: Oh, are you going to help me with my dream Décor design? Great! Which of these Décor items would you dream about?
Well, if you'd like to give me your opinion on my dream Décor, please come back!
Oh, you have impeccable taste! That's it. This Décor is so great that people will dream about it! Your advice was very helpful. Next time I come up with great designs, I'd love to bounce my ideas off you again!
Everybody is talking about Décor they dream about. Do you know it?
Hello! My name is Loblolly, and I'm a Décor designer. I am trying to design Décor items that everybody loves and dreams about. Tables and chairs so great you can't stop thinking about them, even in your sleep... That's the kind of Décor I'm talking about.

Oh! I was looking for a Pass Orb, and I somehow ended up here. They are often found at the entrance of a Pokémon Center, though.
Hey! When I looked at myself, I noticed I've become an Infielder! How did this happen?! Whatever shall I do? I have to go to school soon!

Pass Orbs are often found under signboards of cities or towns! ...But where am I? When I passed under a signboard, everybody disappeared.
People say Pass Orbs are created by feelings of gratitude! They say the orbs will pour out if you help someone!

Back home, I'm a boy. But when I looked at a mirror earlier... Why? Why did I become like this?! Is this also a power of the Entralink?
Hmmm. I came back here again. I was fast asleep until a while ago. Maybe this is a dream world. A dream world is always black and white.

There must be a reason why the landscape of Unova forms a circle! I was researching each area thinking about that, and I ended up here. Where am I?

Doug: Please excuse me. I was able to get enough rest, so perhaps I should head to Black City!
Doug: Why, hello there. I've been having trouble recently, because my work isn't going well. If I were in Black City, I'm sure I could handle demanding jobs...
Doug: Why, hello there. I've been having trouble recently, because my work isn't going well. Would you be so kind as to take me to Black City?
Oh, I see. Do forgive the presumption.

All riiight! Exciting urban living, here I come!  Hey, thanks!

Gene: I'd sure like to go to a place where I can test my skill as a Trainer.
Gene: Your Black City looks pretty fun, eh? I'd like to go visit it.
Gene: I love Pokémon, and I'm wanting to test my skill as a Trainer with the Pokémon I've caught. Could you take me to Black City?
Whaaat! That's disappointing... I'll wait for the next opportunity!
Hmph!  I've definitely changed my mind. I've decided to go to another Black City.

Yahooo! I look forward to seeing how good I am in a new environment.

What?! Cheapskate.
I'm such a flirt... Truth is: I found someone else. I decided to go to their Black City. I'm sorry.

Thank you! In Black City, I will get even cuter!
Shane: I'm moving to Black City. I'm excited to see how I'll do in the big city. My heart's pounding! Buh-dup!
Shane: I want to see what people in Black City will think of me.
Shane: I'm jealous of your Black City. I'd like to go too.
Shane: I wonder how I will be seen in Black City. I'd like to see for myself. Hey! Will you take me to Black City?
Too bad. I wanted to go to your city.
Sorry! I decided to follow someone else. My bad.

Thanks a lot! I'm going to see what I'm made of in Black City!
Ralph: Yahoo! Starting now, I'm leaving for Black City! I'll give it my best shot!
Ralph: Sigh... I want to communicate my feelings more directly... I want to go to Black City.
Ralph: Your Black City... It looks like everyone can express how they feel directly. It looks fun...
Ralph: Recently, I've been thinking I want to communicate my feelings more directly... Would you take me to Black City?
What... I'm shocked you don't understand my feelings...
Oh! Something came up, and my plans have changed. Sorry!

Yahoo! I'm overflowing with emotions! I'm going to express them in Black City!
Eliza: I'm leaving for Black City! I want to buy a lot of different things!
Eliza: White Forest is rich in nature, but it feels like something's missing.
Eliza: Black City... I bet you can buy many things there. I'm jealous...
Eliza: White Forest is rich in nature, but something is missing. That's it! Would you take me to Black City?
Is that so... Too bad...
I've changed my mind. I'm going to a different Black City.

I'm so happy! I'm looking forward to living in Black City.
Collin: Opportunity, opportunity! Business opportunities galore in Black City! Piles of money, here I come!
Collin: I'm looking for a business doing something no one has done before. But since no one's doing it, I can't figure out what it is!
Collin: I've looked for business opportunities in this rural area, but nothing interesting is rolling my way...
Collin: Opportunities didn't exist here! Going after big opportunities is more my style! Hate to be a bother, but can you take me to Black City?
A Clerk ⑭ has to be patient. I'll wait until you are ready to take me!
Oh! I just thought of another business opportunity! Sorry, but I'm going somewhere else!

All right! In Black City, I'm going to make the business opportunity mine!
Ken: I'm leaving for Black City! I'm going to become a master of Pokémon battles in a new city!
Ken: In White Forest, I cannot master Pokémon battling...
Ken: Your Black City seems like a bustling place for Pokémon battles. I'm jealous.
Ken: I want to live where I can become a master Pokémon battler. Will you please take me to your city?
Really. Fine, I'll ask someone else.
I've changed my mind. I'm going to go to a different Black City.

I'm going to become the best Trainer I can be in Black City!
Jacques: I'm going to leave for Black City to find a clear answer!
Jacques: Sigh... I want to do the kind of research where I get one clear answer.
Jacques: Your Black City... I'm jealous because it looks like you can find a really excellent answer.
Jacques: It looks like I can do research to find clear, really excellent answers in your Black City! Would you take me to your city?
I'm really disappointed by your clear answer!
Oh, I've decided to go to a different Black City! The answer I'm looking for is there!

Oh! The answer I wanted! Thank you!
Rosa: I'm leaving for Black City! I'm looking forward to it, because it looks like it's never boring!
Rosa: Just living from day to day... I've had it with this life. I want to go someplace where I won't get so bored!
Rosa: Your Black City. It looks exciting. I'm jealous.
Rosa: I want my everyday life to be more fun! Won't you take me to your Black City?
My my! Aren't you the selfish one!
I've changed my mind. I'm going to a different city!

Oh boy! A life without boredom! I'm looking forward to it!
Herman: Next, I'm going to Black City! Are you jealous?
Herman: Aaah... I want to go to Black City! Just staying in one place isn't like me!
Herman: Black City seems like an interesting city. I'd like to go sometime!
Herman: I'm getting tired of living here! Could you take me to Black City?
Fine. Whatever.
Changed my mind! I'm setting off for a different city!

All right! Thanks! I'm looking forward to my next trip!
Emi: I'm setting off for my next city! Black City! It looks like fun, right?
Emi: Oh, I want to set off for my next city soon!
Emi: Black City sounds nice! I'd like to go there!
Emi: The goal of my next trip is Pokémon battles! Hey, will you take me to Black City?
What?! Too bad...
Uh, I've given up on that! I decided to go to a different Black City!

Thank you! Looks like my next trip will be fun!
Grace: I'm searching for bold, new art! Next, I'm going to Black City!
Grace: I think only nature-made beauty is not enough... Don't you feel that way?
Grace: Black City... Now, that is art created by people. I want to see it with my own eyes!
Grace: Black City... Now that is art created by people! I want to see it with my own eyes. You... Could you take me there?
Your direct answer is also beautiful.
Oh, what was that? Oh, that's right. I'm going to a different Black City. Sorry I changed my mind like that.

Thank you. I'm looking forward to the beauty of Black City!
Leo: Oh, me? I'm moving to White Forest! I want to relax a little more!
Leo: Black City also has some nice places, but it's a little too exciting for me.
Leo: White Forest... I'm really interested in it!
Leo: I'm starving for a little quiet, so I want to go to White Forest! If you don't mind, would you take me there?
What! You won't... Let me know if you change your mind.
Oh! Sorry! I got an invitation from another place!

What? Really? That's great! The gifts of the forest are waiting for me! I'll wait for you in White Forest!
Silvia: I'm moving to White Forest to get out of this rut! I'm looking forward to the fresh air!
Silvia: A new life in a place you've never seen, far away from home... Every girl dreams of this.
Silvia: All girls fall in love with big, natural places!
Silvia: A new life in a place you've never seen, far away from home! You, the one reflected in my glasses, take me to White Forest!
So, it's not going to work out? I'd sure like it if you'd take me along, though...
I'm sorry! It looks like my glinting glasses caught someone else's eye!

That someone who was reflected in my glasses is you! I'll be waiting in White Forest!
Dave: Oh, sorry. I'm moving to White Forest! I've discovered that even a tough can be too tough and get worn out!
Dave: 'Sup. I became the roughest tough in Black City. Time to aim for the top someplace new.
Dave: That White Forest... It's really glittering. That's also pretty interesting...
Dave: In Black City, I'm the toughest tough who ever toughed. No man alive can stop me here. Hey, will you take me to White Forest?
Seriously... I'll polish myself into the kind of man you want to take with you.
Sorry, I got invited by someone else. Invite me again sometime!

Thanks, yo! This Roughneck is going to be the head of White Forest!
Britney: I've done decided to head to White Forest! Nature is waitin' for me!
Britney: Freewheelin' is nice for sure, but I also like windin' down!
Britney: White Forest... That's where I wanna be!
Britney: Won't somebody take me to White Forest? Why, hey! I'd be much obliged if you could take me?
Now, whyever not?! Well, take me next time, OK?
Oh, I'm sorry! Someone else done invited me!

Thankee! I'll go on ahead to the forest!
Robbie: Guess what? I'm moving to White Forest! Without nature all around, it's hard to settle in, right?!
Robbie: Black City isn't a bad place, but now I'm thinking White Forest might be pretty nice too.
Robbie: Hey! Over there! White Forest looks so fun. I sure wish I could go!!
Robbie: Oh! That White Forest over there! It looks like fun! I've got it! You, take me with you! Come on!
Robbie: Aww, why not? Well, if you change your mind...
Oh! I'm sorry!! I'm going to someone else's place.

Thank you! I'm heading to White Forest now. See you there!
Miki: I decided to go to White Forest. I'm a little quiet, and I'm worried I won't fit in.
Miki: It's comfortable here, but it's a little too exciting.
Miki: White Forest... Sounds like fun, doesn't it.  If I had the chance, I'd sure love to go.
Miki: White Forest... Sounds fun, doesn't it. If I had the chance, I'd sure love to go. Hey, you wouldn't mind taking me along, would you?
Sniff... Don't you want me to come?
Oh! I was invited by somebody else. I'm sorry.

Thank you! I'll do my best in White Forest!
Ryder: 'Sup! Well, I'm moving to White Forest. Training amidst nature is a pretty good idea, right?
Ryder: Hyah! Hyah hyah... I'm having trouble getting pumped up! I wonder if my body can keep up with continuous training.
Ryder: I've tested my abilities enough. I want to train soon...
Ryder: I've tested my abilities plenty now. I want to train! Would you mind taking me to White Forest?
I see... That's too bad. Talk to me again sometime.
Oh... My apologies. Another person invited me.

Thank you! I know the location! I'll go on ahead to White Forest!
Karenna: Aaaahh... Bring it on! I've decided to go to White Forest! Training is gonna be super hot!
Karenna: I've battled and battled. My Pokémon and I might be a little tired...
Karenna: To get the most out of my battling, I must train!
Karenna: I want to get the most from my battles by training! Hey! If you want, would you take me to White Forest?!
No way... Well, next time then, OK?
Oh! I'm so sorry! I'm going to someone else's place.

This will make me even stronger! Thank you so much! OK then, I'll go on ahead and be waiting in White Forest!
Doug: Why, hello there! It is my intention to take up residence in White Forest.
Doug: Well hello! It's very exciting here, but weariness tends to build up!
Doug: Why hello there. I've been having trouble recently, because my work isn't going well. If I were in White Forest, I'm sure I could get a little relief!
Doug: Why hello there. I've been having trouble recently, because my work isn't going well. Would you be so kind as to take me to White Forest?
Oh, I see. Do forgive the presumption.
Oh dear. Your timing is most unfortunate. I'm afraid I have already accepted another invitation.

Thank you very much! Well then, I shall be off. I shall see you there!
Vincent: Hey! It's you! Well, I'm off to show my brilliance in White Forest! The beautiful forest awaits!
Vincent: Living here is a little boring for a guy like me.
Vincent: Maybe I would be a good match for that White Forest.
Vincent: I was considering favoring that White Forest with a visit. It seems fitting to me, but what do you think?
Sorry, I couldn't hear you. Maybe I'll ask again later.
Oooh. Sorry! I'm very popular! I'm already booked up.

Well if you really want me to join you... I guess I'll have to go to White Forest, then. Just for you!
Marie: I'm full of enough energy now! I'm going to White Forest!
Marie: I'm really tired, and I want to go back to White Forest.

Marie: White Forest! How nice! I want to go too. I've got it! Would you be a dear and take me there?
Oh my. Are you in a bad mood?
My oh my. I'm sorry. I was invited by someone else.

Thank you! Thank you! Well I'll go on ahead then.
Lena: White Forest... I've decided to go there.
Lena: The city refuses nature. Is that the right thing? I'd like to find out in the forest.
Lena: Hmm... It's so busy here. My spirit can never rest.
Lena: I want to go to that White Forest too... Mind if I go with you?
I see... Too bad.
Sorry. I was invited by someone else...

Thank you. I'll be waiting in White Forest...
Carlos: Heeey! I decided to give going to White Forest a try. It'll be a laid-back, freewheeling trip!
Carlos: I enjoy looking at the big city, but I miss nature!
Carlos: As a Backpacker, I want to go places where there is beautiful scenery!
Carlos: I've had plenty of big-city flavor. I think that's enough! Hey, you! Could you please take me to White Forest?
Hmmm... Isn't there any way I could go? I really want you to take me there...
Huh? I'm sorry. I'm going to go to someone else's place.

Oh! Thanks! Well, I'll head to White Forest then! See you later, OK?
Molly: I'm going to White Forest! I'd rather see lots of places than stay in one spot!
Molly: I think I need a change of scenery soon. I want to see lots of different places!
Molly: I want to go somewhere different soon. Know any nice places?
Molly: OK, it's decided! I'm going to leave this place! That's why I have something to ask you. Could you take me to White Forest?
What? Even though I asked nicely! I'm crestfallen...
I was invited by someone else... Sorry, but I'm going there.

Thank you! I'll head there right now! See you in White Forest! Thanks again!
Frederic: Sorry, but I'm leaving for White Forest. I'm preparing for my move now. If you need something, tell me in White Forest!
Frederic: My Pokémon are stubbornly insisting we go to White Forest!
Frederic: White Forest, huh... My Pokémon are noisily insisting on going.
Frederic: White Forest, huh... My Pokémon are noisily insisting on going. Oh hey, I need a favor! Could you take me to White Forest?
What? Have you no respect for your elders? If you come around, I'll be waiting, young one.
Sorry! I'd completely forgotten, but my destination has already been decided.

Well said. I'm grateful! Well then, I'm going to head to White Forest. I'll be waiting!
Lynette: I'm tired of searching for strong people. For now, I'm going to relax in White Forest.
Lynette: I'm tired of living like this. For now, I just want to rest and recover.
Lynette: Your White Forest seems really charming. I'd like to live there.
Lynette: I'm tired of searching for my destiny. If it's OK with you, could you take me to White Forest?
My! I can't believe you are so rude as to refuse my request.
I've changed my mind. I found a different, wonderful person... I'm ever so sorry.

I'd like to thank you. I'll try to enjoy a leisurely life with Pokémon.
Pierce: I'm a-goin' to White Forest. I'd like to live the slow life.
Pierce: Ah, the cultured life is restless and exhausting.
Pierce: Hmmm. Your White Forest seems to be a comfortable place. I'm jealous...
Pierce: I'm tired of this restless life. I want life to be more laid back. Would you take me to your White Forest?
What a shame... Au revoir, lovely country life!
Hey! Sorry! I decided to go to a different White Forest! Lo siento!

Thank you for taking me with you. I'm going to enjoy the relaxed life for awhile.
Gene: I'm going to move to White Forest! I'm excited about the Pokémon I will encounter in nature!
Gene: Hmmm... I'm tired of testing myself as a Trainer. I want to live the kind of life where I meet Pokémon every day!
Gene: It looks like you can meet a lot of Pokémon in your White Forest! It seems charming.
Gene: Testing my abilities was exciting, but I'm tired of it! I want to live while watching Pokémon. Could you take me to White Forest?
Whaaat! That's disappointing... I'll wait for the next opportunity!
Hmph! I've definitely changed my mind. I've decided to go to a different White Forest.

Ha ha! I'm looking forward to a life where I can leisurely encounter Pokémon! Hey, thanks!
Piper: I'm moving to White Forest now! I'm looking forward to a fresh start!

Oh... That's too bad.
I'm sorry. I've changed my mind. I've decided to go to a different White Forest.

Thank you! I'm looking forward to leisurely passing time in White Forest!
Miho: I'm going to move to White Forest! I look forward to living with cute Pokémon!
Miho: Recently, I'm tired of decorating myself... I want to live the slow life in White Forest.
Miho: I'm jealous. That White Forest looks like it has many cute Pokémon in it!
Miho: I'm tired of shopping and being fashionable. I want to go to White Forest where I can be more in my natural state. Would you take me?
What?! Cheapskate.
I'm such a flirt... Truth is: I found someone else. I decided to go to their White Forest. I'm sorry.

Thank you! In White Forest, I'll just live naturally. I won't try too hard to deck myself out.
Shane: I'm moving to White Forest. I'm going to entrust myself to nature. I'm looking forward to it!
Shane: Recently, I've been thinking it would be nice to live in White Forest and just be as I am without worrying about how other people see me.
Shane: I'm jealous of your White Forest! I'd like to go too.
Shane: I've been thinking I just want to be myself and not worry about how other people judge me. Will you take me to White Forest?
Too bad. I wanted to go to your city.
Sorry! I decided to follow someone else. My bad.

Thanks a lot! I think I can live just like I am in White Forest!
Ralph: I'm leaving for White Forest right now! I want to share my feelings with a lot of different people and Pokémon!
Ralph: Sigh... I want to share my feelings with more people and Pokémon. I want to live like that...
Ralph: Your White Forest... Seems like everyone can communicate their feelings to each other. I'm jealous...
Ralph: Recently, I've been wanting to live where I communicate what I'm feeling not only to my opponent, but to more people and Pokémon as well. Please take me to your White Forest!
What... I'm shocked you don't understand my feelings...
Oh! I have another place I want to go because of a different thing that came up! Sorry!

I'm really happy. Now, I can live a life where I communicate my feelings to many people and Pokémon.
Eliza: I'm leaving for White Forest! I wonder what kind of place it is?
Eliza: You can get anything in Black City, but it feels like something's missing.
Eliza: White Forest seems spiritually fulfilling. I'm jealous that you can live like that...
Eliza: In Black City, you can get whatever you want, but something is missing. That's it! Would you take me to White Forest?
Is that so... Too bad...
I've changed my mind. I'm going to a different White Forest.

I'm so happy! I'm looking forward to living in White Forest.
Collin: Opportunities! Business opportunities galore in White Forest!  Piles of money, here I come!
Collin: Even if I think of something, usually someone has beaten me to it! Making money isn't easy!
Collin: I've looked for business opportunities only found in the big city, but nothing that interesting is rolling my way...
Collin: Opportunities didn't exist here! Going after business off the beaten path is more my style! Hate to be a bother, but can you take me to White Forest?
A Clerk ⑭ has to be patient. I'll wait until you are ready to take me!
Oh! I just thought of another business opportunity! Sorry, but I'm going somewhere else!

All right! In White Forest, I'm going to be a success!
Ken: I'm leaving for White Forest! I'm going to obtain a wide variety of knowledge in a new place!
Ken: In Black City, all I do is Pokémon battling... If I think about it, there's something missing for me as a Trainer. I want to spend time in an environment that will give me a wider point of view.
Ken: Your White Forest seems like a place with a lot of Pokémon. I'm jealous, because you can widen your horizons.
Ken: As a Pokémon Trainer, I want to look at Pokémon from a wider point of view. Will you please take me to your forest?
Really. I'll ask someone else.
I've changed my mind. I'm going to go to a different White Forest.

OK! I'm going to widen my point of view as a Trainer in White Forest!
Jacques: I want to find a variety of answers, so I'm going to White Forest!
Jacques: Sigh... I want research in an environment where I get many different answers...
Jacques: Your White Forest... It's full of variations! It looks like I can do my research there!
Jacques: It seems like there is really a lot of variation in your White Forest. It seems like it might enhance my research! Would you take me there?
I'm really disappointed by your clear answer!
Oh, I've decided to go to a different White Forest! The answers I'm looking for are there!

Oh! Thank you!
Rosa: I'm leaving for White Forest! It seems like there, I can live each day to the fullest!
Rosa: Just living, killing time from day to day... Recently, I've been wondering if this is a good way to live.
Rosa: Your White Forest looks like a place where you can live to the fullest. I'm jealous.
Rosa: I want to treat every day with more importance. Won't you take me to your White Forest?
My! Aren't you the selfish one!
I've changed my mind. I'm going to a different place!

Oh boy! Living life to the fullest! I'm looking forward to it!
Herman: Next, I'm going to White Forest! Are you jealous?
Herman: Aaah... I want to go to White Forest! I'm tired of this wandering life.
Herman: White Forest seems like a place that's easy to live in. I'd like to go sometime!

Fine. Whatever.
Changed my mind! I'm setting off for a different place!

All right! Thanks! I'm looking forward to my next trip!
Emi: I'm setting off for my next place! White Forest! It looks like fun, right?
Emi: Oh, I want to set off for my next destination soon!
Emi: White Forest sounds nice! I'd like to go there!
Emi: I don't have a goal for my next trip! I want to relax. White Forest sounds nice. Hey, will you take me there?
What?! Too bad...
Uh, I've given up on that! I decided to go to a different White Forest!

Thank you! Looks like my next trip will be fun!
Grace: I'm searching for bold, new art! Next, I'm going to White Forest!
Grace: I think beauty made only by people is not enough... Don't you feel that way?
Grace: White Forest... Now, that is art created by nature. I want to see it with my own eyes!
Grace: White Forest... Now that is art created by nature! I want to see it with my own eyes. You... Could you take me there?
Your direct answer is also beautiful.
Oh, what was that? Oh, that's right. I'm going to a different White Forest. Sorry I changed my mind like that.

Thank you. I'm looking forward to the beauty of White Forest!

It is believed that dreams and desires of people and Pokémon in Unova swirled into the center and were formed into Pass Power.
Maybe people in the past created the landscape of Unova that looks like a swirl in order to use Pass Power...

===============================
Text File: 345
===============================
People say the ruins of the Entralink have existed since long before we started living with Pokémon. It's unbelievable that this power has existed for such a long time.
Huh? Where did everybody go? I came to the sea with other people, and I was playing with them...

Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. We restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. We restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. We restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Hey! Is today your birthday?
Happy birthday! Please keep visiting the Pokémon Center for many years to come. Now, would you like to rest your Pokémon?
It isn't? Oh, I must have been confused. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
OK, I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds.
Thank you for waiting. We've restored your Pokémon to full health.
We hope to see you again!
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. We restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to...
Th-that Trainer Card! That wonderful shade! That sparkle! I've seen several Trainers with Silver Trainer Cards already... But you're the first to top them all with that impressive Trainer Card. Oh, VAR(256, 0), may I please heal your Pokémon?
Great to see you, VAR(256, 0)! You want the usual, right?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.
Welcome to the Pokémon Wireless Club Union Room. You may interact directly with many Trainers here. Would you like to enter the room?
The Trainers in the Union Room will be those players around you who have also entered the room. You may trade your Pokémon here or have battles for two or four. Also, you may exchange Eggs or draw pictures with other players. You may also chat with other players in the room. Or you may find friends by touching the spoken words. Would you like to enter the room?
DS Wireless Communications will be launched.
I hope you enjoy your time in the Union Room.
Please do visit again.

Info
I am sorry... You can't enter the Union Room yet.
You have at least one Pokémon that can't be taken in.
Wait, Trainer! Your title on your Trainer Card is still just “Pokémon Trainer," isn't it? If you change your title, you can easily project your image to others when you greet them in the Union Room. Let's see... How about VAR(270, 0)? What do you think? That is the impression I got from you. First, let's change your title. If you don't like the new one, you can change it by selecting your Trainer Card.
It seems you can't use it yet.

Er... Who was I again? ... ... ...Oh, that's right! I am the Move Deleter!
You've come to make me force your Pokémon to forget some moves?
Which Pokémon should forget a move?
Remember me if there are moves that need to be forgotten.
That Pokémon knows only one move, so it can't be forgotten...
What? That's an Egg. No Egg should know any moves.
OK, then. Which move should be forgotten?
Hm! The move VAR(263, 0)? Should that move be forgotten?
It worked perfectly! Your Pokémon has forgotten the move VAR(263, 0) completely.











Which move should VAR(258, 0) remember?
Should the move VAR(263, 1) be remembered?
Give up trying to make  VAR(258, 0) remember a move?
VAR(258, 0) remembered the move VAR(263, 1) it had forgotten!
VAR(258, 0) wants to remember the move VAR(263, 1). But VAR(258, 0) can't learn more than four moves. Delete an existing move to make  room for VAR(263, 1)?
1, VAR(48642, 20)2, andVAR(48642, 20)... VAR(48642, 20)... VAR(48642, 20)... Ta-da!VAR(48645, 3)VAR(48645, 5)  VAR(258, 0) forgot how to use VAR(263, 1). And...
VAR(258, 0) remembered the move VAR(263, 1) it had forgotten!
Give up on making the Pokémon remember VAR(263, 1)?
VAR(258, 0) did not remember the move VAR(263, 1).
VAR(256, 0) handed over one Heart Scale in exchange.
Is it OK to forget the move VAR(263, 0)?
Everybody calls me the reminder girl. I know every move that Pokémon learn while they're leveling up. And I can make Pokémon remember those moves! If you bring me a Heart Scale, I'll make a Pokémon remember a move.
Should a move be remembered?
Which Pokémon should learn it?
If any of your Pokémon needs to remember a move, bring me a Heart Scale!
Eggs can't remember moves!
This Pokémon hasn't forgotten any moves.

Cheren: Professor Juniper, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Professor Juniper: Now that everyone's here, I'll explain. The Pokédex's pages update automatically whenever you meet a Pokémon! Moreover, it's set up so that you obtain even more information when you catch a Pokémon! To make this clear, I'm going to demonstrate how to catch a Pokémon!
Professor Juniper: Did you see that, just now? Here's how it goes, step by step. First, reduce the Pokémon's HP! Pokémon that still have all of their energy are difficult to catch. If you can, use your Pokémon's moves to make the Pokémon you want to catch fall asleep. Or paralyze it! And to wrap this up in the best way, I have a gift for you--some Poké Balls!

Professor Juniper: Poké Balls are used for catching Pokémon and for carrying the Pokémon you catch! I'm going on ahead. I'll be waiting for you in Accumula Town!
Cheren: She forgot to say that Pokémon jump out at you in the tall grass.
I'm heading to Accumula Town, too.
Bianca: I think I'll go, too. I'm looking forward to the next town so I can go shopping for Poké Balls!
Bianca: Wait a minute! Hey, listen! VAR(256, 0), Cheren, I thought of something fun!
Cheren: But we need to get going! I'd imagine the professor's waiting, too.
Bianca: Would you just listen a sec? Seriously! Why don't we see who can catch the most Pokémon? The person carrying the most Pokémon, including the one received from Professor Juniper, is the winner!
Cheren: Huh. Actually, that sounds interesting. It will fill up Pokédex pages, so I'm sure it will please the professor, too. OK, then. Until we reach Accumula Town, take care of healing your Pokémon at your own house.
Bianca: Me and VAR(257, 0) will do the best for sure!
Cheren: VAR(256, 0), are you going to compare yourself with Bianca? Both Bianca and I have two Pokémon with us.
Bianca: How about it, VAR(256, 0)? Do you want to compare which one of us has the most Pokémon with them?
Bianca: Hmm... Guess I'll be waiting here, then.
Bianca: Wow, VAR(512, 0)?! That's awesome! Are you excited to have that many Pokémon with you?
Bianca: Seems the number of Pokémon VAR(256, 0) has is... Two! We all have the same number, then!
Bianca: What? What? What? You only have VAR(257, 0)?! If you don't catch any Pokémon, won't VAR(257, 0) get lonely?
Cheren: Incidentally, if you check your Pokédex, you'll see how many Pokémon you've found and how many you've caught. I'm off to Accumula Town! The professor is waiting.

The Xtransceiver is ringing.
VAR(256, 0) picked up the Xtransceiver.
Cheren: Well, I'm going on ahead.
Is your Pokémon's HP all right? When your Pokémon's HP decreases while you're on the road, it can be a big problem, so I'll give you this. Put it in your Bag's Medicine Case.
When your Pokémon's HP decreases, they no longer have the energy to fight. So, don't push your Pokémon too hard, and let them rest often.
Wild Pokémon are hiding in the tall grass. What does this mean for you? It means when you want to battle or capture wild Pokémon, you should go walk in the tall grass.

We're going to combine our strength and do our best, so please watch!
Ummm... One plus one is two, right?
Maybe I could have won if I had used a Potion or something at some point?
It's hard to win in a Double Battle if one Pokémon faints.
Cheren: VAR(256, 0), stop! We both have a Trio Badge, so let's see which of us is stronger!
Cheren: I see. So that's how you battle.

Cheren: What was that about?
Bianca? Why are you running?
Bianca: Hey! Where were those people headed?
Cheren: That way, but...
Why are you running now?
Bianca: Oh, seriously! They run so fast!
Little Girl: Miss... Oh... My Pokémon?
Bianca: It'll be OK. It'll be OK. Don't cry.
Cheren: Bianca, really, why were you running?
Bianca: You have to hear this! Those people stole this girl's Pokémon!
Cheren: You should have spoken up sooner!

Then let's go.

I happen to be the daughter of the couple running the Pokémon Day Care next door! I know, it's sweet, isn't it? Parents and daughter all bringing up youngsters for a living. Helping Pokémon and people grow up healthy is a wonderful thing!
Are you familiar with Double Battles?
Oh, I do love explaining how things work. Now, a Double Battle is a Pokémon battle with two Pokémon on each side. Choosing two that combine well is vital.
You do have a Gym Badge, after all. You're well aware that Double Battles are Pokémon battles where each side uses two Pokémon!
Seriously. Guys are all just little boys.
Yeah! Yeah!
Rrrraaaaar! I'll run! You gonna chase me?  You run! Am I gonna chase you? Change your perspective-- and the reality changes.

Team Plasma: Wha...? How could we lose when we have right on our side?!
Cheren: Not bad, VAR(256, 0). OK, go return the Pokémon to that girl.
You don't need to return it!
Team Plasma: How troublesome. Not only do you fail to understand, but you actually got in our way, to boot.
Team Plasma: There's two of you and two of us. We'll show you our combined power and teach you that we are right!
Cheren: So, there were more of them... Still, why are Pokémon robbers acting so self-righteous?
VAR(256, 0)! We've been friends our whole lives. We've got each other's back when it counts. Let's show them how it's done!
Team Plasma: In order to liberate Pokémon from foolish people, we will take their Pokémon!
Cheren: Whatever... What a waste of time. Come on, what reason could possibly justify stealing Pokémon from people?
Team Plasma: Pokémon Trainers like you are making Pokémon suffer...
Cheren: What do you mean, Trainers are making Pokémon suffer? I don't get that at all!
Team Plasma: We'll give you back the Pokémon... But be aware of how this Pokémon suffers from being used by people.
Team Plasma: Someday, open your eyes to your own complicity.
Cheren: Trainers bring out their Pokémon's strength. Pokémon believe in their Trainers and respond to that. I don't understand what about that makes Pokémon suffer!
OK, VAR(256, 0), I'll return the Pokémon.

Deep in the desert ahead of here, at the Desert Resort, there are some ruins that have become a little tourist destination!

Cheren: Hey, VAR(256, 0). I've been waiting for you to get the Insect Badge. And now it's time to see which one of us is the stronger Trainer!
Cheren: It's now clear to me. The reason you are so tough is the trust between you and your Pokémon. But...that shouldn't be a problem. I can get more out of VAR(257, 0) and my other Pokémon, too.

Trainer Tips!  Pokémon have a source of energy for using moves. It's called PP, meaning Power Points. They have PP for each move. When a move has no PP remaining, that Pokémon cannot use that move. That's a good time to head for the Pokémon Center!

Cheren: Why? Why can't I beat you?
Elesa: Oh, you two are friends... That's nice, how you're helping each other get better by competing.
OK, let's go.
???: Oh! Why, if it isn't Elesa!
???: Aren't festivals grand? Life should be enjoyed!
Cheren: Who is this man?
Elesa: This is Alder, the Unova region's Champion.
Cheren: Champion?! Why would the Champion be goofing off in a place like this?
Alder: I heard that remark. You're quite a judgmental young person, are you not? My name is Alder. I'm the Unova Pokémon League's Champion. Pleased to make your acquaintance. For your information, I'm not goofing off. I'm on a voyage. I know every corner of Unova.
Cheren: Um. I'm Cheren, from Nuvema Town. My goal as a Trainer is to become the Champion.
Alder: Hm. Traveling with a goal in mind is a commendable thing. And what do you plan to do after becoming the Champion?
Cheren: What else is there other than striving to become stronger? The strongest Trainer-- that's the Champion.
Alder: Hmm. Becoming stronger... Becoming stronger, you say... Is that alone enough of a goal? Hmmm. It's not that I'm trying to say your way of thinking is wrong...
In my travels, I've helped many people learn to love Pokémon. I think that's important, too. If you play with those children, you might gain more of an understanding. Will you two have a Pokémon battle with those two?
Hey, you two. Come here for a moment.
Cheren: ...Understood. But, before that...
Cheren fully healed  VAR(256, 0)'s Pokémon!
Cheren: OK, let's battle.
Alder: Nicely done! You didn't win, but that was a good battle. Your Pokémon looked like they were having fun.
Young man, if there are people like you who pursue strength, there are also people who are happy just being with Pokémon. There are many different people and many different answers. When it comes to what a Champion should be, you and I may hold differing views, but so be it! Give it some thought.
Alder: It's tremendous that people and Pokémon, each so different, can acknowledge each other and be together!
Alder is so strong! And he's nice to Pokémon!
I was scared of Pokémon, but Alder taught me that they're nice and friendly.
Elesa: Let's roll. The Driftveil Drawbridge is just ahead.
Cheren: The Champion is the strongest of the strong! That's all there is to it.
Cheren: This way.
Elesa: Now to contact him...
It's me, Elesa. Please lower the drawbridge. I have a couple of Trainers here who want to challenge you. OK... Thanks.
Now, watch this!
Elesa: I have a TV gig, so I've got to go. The Gym Leader of the next town may take some getting used to... Do your best, both of you.
Cheren: What I am is a Trainer. I prove I'm right by getting stronger and winning in battle-- even against the Champion.
Excuse me! Please stop right there!
The drawbridge is raised right now so ships can pass. You can't cross. If you make a request to Driftveil's Gym Leader, Clay, he could... Well, I'm not sure how you'd reach him over there... If you talk to Nimbasa City's Gym Leader, Elesa, she might be able to do something.

A bridge would be meaningless if no one ever crossed it. Bridges connect the world... That's as solid as a symbol can get.
Hum fiercely! My battle song! Battle fiercely! My Pokémon!
In battling you, I came to understand... You're the best! Here! This is for you!


If you want your Pokémon to hold this Electric Guitar, go to the Musical Theater! Cooler than cool!
Cheren: Strength and strength alone is what matters in this world. So I believed, until I met Alder here.
But, winning in Pokémon battles isn't all there is to life. Once I learned that lesson, my eyes were opened to many different things.
We all have our own brand of strength, people and Pokémon both. The strength to make our dreams a reality, the strength to protect what we hold most dear...
Why do I think this way now? It's thanks to you, VAR(256, 0)... And Bianca... And Alder... If only N could see this, too, someday.
I'm going to take a long, hard look at myself on Victory Road. I'm going to think about what I can do and who I can become... Visit me sometime, if you want. We'll have a battle like old times.
The Pokémon and the performers all have amazing moves!
I think being able to make people smile is a super-awesome talent! That's why Pokémon are so awesome! Because they can make you smile!
The street performers are my favorites. They're so charming!

Here on Route 6, there's a place called Mistralton Cave. Supposedly, deep in that cave you can find an amazing Pokémon called Cobalion, who was said to have protected Pokémon from a sea of fire in ancient Unova. If you can use a move called Surf that lets you move over the water's surface, maybe you can see Cobalion.
I've heard that there are also Pokémon that should be called Cobalion's allies.
Now what should I do? The entrance to Chargestone Cave, just ahead, is blocked off. It's because of a Pokémon called Galvantula, and if I don't ask Clay to do something, there's no way to pass.

This is the Season Research Lab. Twist Mountain, just beyond Mistralton, has snow, depending on the season.
Some Pokémon change their appearance depending on the season. Could that also be considered a type of evolution?
We research changes in nature that occur due to the seasons. Consider the Pokémon called VAR(257, 0), which lives in this forest. Its appearance is said to change according to the season. This characteristic is of great interest to us. We want to research this Pokémon and observe its seasonal changes. That's why we developed a marvelous climate-control system that transcends the seasons and allows us to freely adjust temperature and humidity!
Up to this point, everything has been fine...but we are very busy, and we haven't really had a chance to catch many VAR(257, 0) to study. So, this is what we would like to ask you. First, please capture a VAR(257, 0). Then, when its appearance changes, could you bring it back to the lab? Then, when we've confirmed the change to the VAR(257, 0) you bring us, we will also go search for that season's VAR(257, 0).
How about it? If you don't mind, would you please show us what VAR(257, 0) looks like now?
VAR(257, 0)'s Spring Form! The luster of its body and its coloring is like a flower field in the spring! The scent emanating from it is also very floral. Thank you so much! I want to go catch my own VAR(257, 0) right away!
VAR(257, 0)'s Summer Form! The luster of its body and its coloring is like a thicket in summer! The scent emanating from it is also very fresh and green. Thank you so much! I want to go catch my own VAR(257, 0) right away!
VAR(257, 0)'s Autumn Form! The luster of its body and its coloring is like a tree-lined road with falling leaves dancing down! The scent emanating from it is also like dry leaves. Thank you so much! I want to go catch my own VAR(257, 0) right away!
VAR(257, 0)'s Winter Form. The luster of its body and its coloring is like the slope of a mountain! The scent emanating from it is also like fresh snow. Thank you so much! I want to go catch my own VAR(257, 0) right away!
Thank you very much! But we've already caught that Form of VAR(257, 0).
Oh, I see. We would be really grateful if you could assist us with our research, but if you're too busy...
Oh! It's you! Thanks to you, we've caught all of the Forms of VAR(257, 0). Now we can thoroughly study the relationship between Pokémon, seasons, and climate. Thank you very much. It isn't much, but please accept this.
This is the only place in the world where you can see VAR(257, 0)'s four seasonal Forms all at one time. They've kind of become our mascots!
I hate to say this, but that Pokémon is not the VAR(257, 0) we're looking for.

The Pokémon climbed up the rock wall and disappeared somewhere into the cave...
The strength you exhibited communicating with your Pokémon also got through to Cobalion. If you and your Pokémon train together and get even stronger, it will probably return to this place.
It seems that thanks to you, Cobalion has sensed a change in the world. It's a world where people and Pokémon help each other and live together. I believe Cobalion wants to remain with you and travel by your side.
The fact that you battled Cobalion and you related to each other should be easily communicated to Terrakion and Virizion because of the close bond between the three. I'm sure they will also give you a chance to prove your worth.
The obstacles that separated Terrakion and Virizion from people are probably gone now. Whether you want to search for those two is up to you, but they are definitely waiting for you...
I saw your skill. It's impressive for one so young. Maybe you're the one... Hmmm... It may be possible... How about it? Will you listen to an old man's story?
In the distant past, when Pokémon and people lived in different worlds, a war between people started an intense fire in a forest where many Pokémon lived. The Pokémon were surrounded by smoke and flames. They were in big trouble. And then, the legends Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion appeared! Terrakion used its amazing strength to destroy rocks blocking the escape route. Virizion used its quick movements to protect Pokémon from looming flames. And Cobalion led the frightened Pokémon out of the burning woods.
The people who started the war were routed by the power of the legends. Because of Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion, the war was ended.
When people fight, there's no peace for Pokémon, either. The three legends learned that the deeds of humans could lead to dire consequences for their world.
They cut themselves off from people and disappeared. No one saw much of them after that, and the three faded into myth...
I've been searching for them for decades, and I finally figured out that one of them was deep in this cave. But the legendary three do not trust people. If people approach, they bare their fangs and attack.
It can't be helped, because they only know the old world... They still don't know the world has become a place where people and Pokémon try to understand and help each other.
You seem like you might be able to show them that people and Pokémon can trust each other and live together. If they take another look at people, I think they will stop hiding from us...
It's not just about bonds between people and Pokémon. Having all living things appreciate and trust each other would be best.
If you don't listen to what your elders have to say, I can't expect much from you! You shouldn't have come to this place! Leave now!

Skyla: Oh, you came. Thank you! I was right. What I saw was a hurt Pokémon. Don't worry, though! It's fine now! I gave it a Max Revive, then it felt better and flew away!
Hee hee! Don't I have great eyesight? No matter how far away things are, a Pilot's eyes can see them!
Oh, that's right! Since you've come this far, why don't you ring the bell? Celestial Tower's bell is for soothing the spirits of Pokémon. Also, the character of the person ringing the bell is reflected in its sound.
Skyla: Come on, don't be shy!
What a pretty sound. VAR(256, 0), you are a kind and strong person. It's that kind of sound.
What a pretty sound. VAR(256, 0), you are a kind and strong person. It's that kind of sound.
I'd like to introduce myself again! I'm Skyla, the Leader of Mistralton's Pokémon Gym. I use Flying-type Pokémon. When you are ready, please come to the Gym. I'll give you a big welcome!
It's the Celestial Tower bell... Will you ring the bell?
VAR(256, 0) rang the bell...
The sound of the bell reverberates through the area...

Alder: ...
My old partner is resting here in the Celestial Tower. It was the first Pokémon I received when I became a Trainer. I come here to ring the bell and comfort its spirit.
It was a strong Pokémon. It was courageous, noble, and kind... Together, we madly pursued strength... Without even knowing the meaning of strength.
But, in the same way that all stories have a beginning and an end, all lives have an end, as well... It was then that I understood that strength isn't something that remains unchanged forever.
However, the joy one feels in being with Pokémon--that is the real thing. In order to spread the word, I left the Pokémon League and kept traveling... That's right! Traveling is wonderful. I've met many different Pokémon, many different Trainers, and now I've met all of you.
There are many more Trainers and Pokémon to encounter in the world! VAR(256, 0)! Go out and meet as many of them as you can!
Well, VAR(256, 0), I'll be waiting for you at the Pokémon League!

Hey! Come on, now! I want to trade for a VAR(257, 0)...

I'm making a delicious soup with well-stewed vegetables.
Since her yammering stops while she's cooking, it's another bonus for me.
Even a young 'un like yourself will catch cold if you get soaked by that cold rain. Sit right down and have some soup, why don't you?
That's nice. A young 'un like you shouldn't be shy.
Come now, just have a little. It's good for you. Would you listen to an old lady's story for a moment?
In the Unova region, you see, there is a Pokémon called Thundurus that creates thunderstorms. It flies around the region and sets loose wild winds and crashing lightning.
In the Unova region, you see, there is a Pokémon called Tornadus that causes windstorms. It flies around the region while letting loose wild winds and pounding rain.
Have some soup now, dear. It'll warm you up.
A soup jam-packed with healthy vegetables. It's delicious!
The heavy rain is ruining the crops I've worked so hard to raise! What a troublesome Pokémon!
I thought I would try to catch it, but it flies around so fast that even when I thought I'd found it, it just flew away.
In one day, it can make a lap around the entire Unova region. In the mornings, it's in the south, and in the evenings, it's in the north. It shows up here in the evenings!
It seems like someone somewhere taught that stormy Pokémon a lesson. I wonder if it was...?
Long ago, I was a sharp-lookin' young man, and my wife was a fiiine-lookin' girl. This is a story from way back then. Right around here, a certain Pokémon taught a lesson to Thundurus, who had been causin' trouble dropping lightning. For around 30 years after that, Thundurus kept calm, and it hid somewhere around here.

As I've been traveling lately, I've been thinking about things. Things like what I can do with my life, and what I want to do, but... I'm thinking how cool it would be to be a model like Elesa. And then, how cool it would be to do research on Pokémon like Professor Juniper... If that's what I want to do, I'm gonna have to know a lot about Pokémon. Sooooo...would you please battle me?
Bianca: Yep! VAR(256, 0), you're amazing! I'm really, really, really impressed, and that makes me want to give this to you!
Bianca: In Castelia City, my precious Pokémon was stolen by Team Plasma. So I really, really understand! If Team Plasma forces everyone to liberate their Pokémon, there will be nothing but sad people! VAR(256, 0)! Stop Team Plasma! Don't allow Pokémon to be stolen from Trainers who love them! I think that's the truth--or ideal--that you've been pursuing, VAR(256, 0)...
Bianca: Oh dear, here I've come all this way, and I'm afraid I'm bothering you when you're going through so much. All I wanted was to help you relax, VAR(256, 0). Knowing you, you'll be fine! Definitely! You'll totally be fine! I guarantee it! Anyway, you know what I mean... Yeah... So, bye-bye!

VAR(258, 0) seems to want to get out of the Poké Ball! Will you let it out?
The Poké Ball has stopped moving...
VAR(258, 0) came jumping out!
Ooh! That Pokémon! It couldn't be... A bright red mane...and a lush tail...and a single, noble horn! It's exactly like the old legend!
Long ago, when a war between people started an intense fire in this forest, a single young Pokémon was separated from its parents. Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion teamed up to take care of this Pokémon.
The three acted as its parents and taught it the knowledge and the moves it needed to survive...
The young Pokémon grew rapidly, and developed a power that surpassed its three caretakers. However... One day, that Pokémon disappeared from the forest. No one knows why. But when I think about it... Young ones are always reckless and drawn to adventure...
It looks like they are all happy to see one another again! I wonder if those three are trying to teach Keldeo something?
Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion are trying to teach VAR(258, 0) the new move Secret Sword! Teach Secret Sword to VAR(258, 0)?



If it weren't for you, these Pokémon never would have been able to meet again here in this forest that holds so many memories for them. I'm sure they are very happy that they were able to meet a Trainer like you.
It seems like it's looking for the three legendary Pokémon that raised it: Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion. Maybe something will happen if you bring them here, too...
How you raise Keldeo is up to you... Sometimes it's necessary to think about things carefully rather than acting on the spur of the moment.
For Keldeo and the three legendary Pokémon of the Unova region--Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion--this forest has a special meaning. It seems like it would be best if you knew this story, as well. Would you mind listening to an old man's story for a moment?
When you want to teach Keldeo this move, you must bring Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion.
A verdant forest and clear water... For Pokémon, this forest is like a paradise. It's also very important for people, so I want to take good care of it!
Would you like to teach Keldeo this move again?
If you don't get to do something you wanted to do, it sure stays with you.

Cheren: Funny? At a time like this...
Bianca: Come on, Cheren. Could you smile just for once? Taking everything so seriously all the time isn't going to change anything. You know... Since we've met our Pokémon and walked the same roads together, a lot has happened... We've all changed a lot! We found out that the things we want to do and the things we can do are different for each of us, right? That's what's made our journey so worth it. Somehow, all this just makes me happy.
Cheren: ...So that's what you mean. ...You are right that we're all different and we should do the things that we can do.

Cheren: There are as many truths and ideals as there are people and Pokémon. The most important thing is that we help one another out. That's why people and Pokémon are always by each other's side. That's what I've come to think lately... VAR(256, 0)! If anything happens to you or Alder, I will do everything I can to help you. That's why I have to keep training and getting stronger. Just...don't be reckless, OK?

Are you and Zekrom building a mutual understanding?
Are you not making friends with Zekrom?
Are you and Reshiram building a mutual understanding?
Are you not making friends with Reshiram?
There is a saying... If somewhere in this world there is someone who understands you, it feels like that person is right beside you, even if you’re as far apart as the end of the land and the top of the sky. As my lord N and his Pokémon understand one another, so, too, do you and your Pokémon understand one another. Which is my reason for giving you this...
Giallo: The legend of Unova is about Pokémon and people working together to build a new world! The message is that simple and that strong. If changing the world makes you a hero, anyone can become a hero. As each of us changes what is in our power to change, so the world itself changes.
Looker: Regarding Team Plasma... I am an officer of the International Police, and you must supply the information I request!
Giallo: Indeed, I shall. Team Plasma changed me, but it could not change the world. I'm looking forward to seeing how you lot will do.
Looker: I beg you will accept my thanks! Now, Ghetsis notwithstanding, there yet remains but VAR(512, 0) of the Seven Sages still at large. What do they think of? What do they hope for? I am intensely interested to know this. To depart at once!
Looker: I thank you extremely! Curiously, VAR(256, 0)... There is a topic on which we must speak. A report has reached my ears of someone far from here. Indeed, this someone has spotted a person like N and a... dragon Pokémon. I depart to substantiate the substance of this information. Until next time, I say cheers to you!

I'd like to trade for a VAR(257, 0)...
Well, if you don't want to, I understand. But if you ever change your mind, please trade Pokémon with me!
I am so grateful that you traded Pokémon with me! My research is making progress, and above all, I'm happy because it is friendly to me.

You know, there are people in the world with many different values.
Some people enjoy things you might not think are fun... Having a lot of different values in the world makes it a richer place. That's what I think, anyway.
I really enjoy traveling around the world and talking with different people, but the woman who lives here seems to think living quietly by herself is important.
Growwwwf!
So this was Zoroark's home, then!
Zoroark was using its illusion to trick people and Pokémon. It wanted to keep people away from its lair. I heard this place was suspicious, so I came to have a look, but it looks like I was tricked as well.
Zoroark really reacted strongly to the Pokémon you have with you... There must be some history there. A quarrel, or something.
Such a beautiful field, in a place like this... It's almost as if this lovely scenery is the illusion!
The suspicious woman attacked!
The Pokémon vanished deep into the forest...

Rood: It smells of the sea here. This place has the same ocean smell as where I was born...
Ghetsis wandered the lands of this world all over, collecting knowledge of all kinds while searching for like-minded people. From the moment we met, he understood what I desired.
The ability to understand the minds and the needs of others... This is an ability that everyone needs to survive. My lord N is a kind and excellent person who understands the hearts of Pokémon. But, conversely, perhaps his ability to understand the hearts and feelings of people is not developed enough.
But... Even that was part of the perfection of Ghetsis's plan. When it comes to Ghetsis, I cannot separate the truths from the lies. See this? I received it from Ghetsis, but I no longer need it. I hope you can put it to good use.
Rood: Someday, if my lord N develops the ability to understand the feelings of people as well as Pokémon, I would like us to gather again. More than anything, I want to see N confront Ghetsis.
Looker: Ah... And now, about Team Plasma... I am an officer of the International Police, and there are so many things you must tell me at once!
Rood: If that is what you desire...
Looker: Many thanks! Now, Ghetsis notwithstanding, there yet remains but VAR(512, 0) of the Seven Sages still at large. What it is they are thinking, what it may be they are hoping, this is the information I have need of. Quick and soon, say I!
Looker: Thank you a lot! Eh, VAR(256, 0)... On a topic I must speak to you. Having received such a report, of someone far from here, who has seen a person like N and...a dragon Pokémon. I am on my way to verify the veracity of this information. We will meet again one day!

Iris: Guess what!! I can teach you the strongest Dragon-type move! Fun, huh? Want me to teach your Pokémon this move?
OK! Well, if you change your mind, come again, OK?
Let me see... Well, this Pokémon can learn the move, but you need to have a really strong bond of friendship first. I don't think I can teach it yet.
OK, great! Oh, but... You don't seem to have a Pokémon that can learn this move.
OK, great! Which Pokémon should learn this move?
Um... I'm sorry... That Pokémon can't learn this move!
What? You want me to teach the move to an Egg? OK, I'll do my best! ... ... Sorry! I think it's impossible!
This one? Um, but...it looks like this Pokémon already knows VAR(263, 0).
Iris: Draco Meteor's power is really amazing! But after you use it, your Sp. Atk stat goes down.

Drayden: If you wish, I can teach your Pokémon the strongest Dragon-type move. Would you like your Pokémon to learn that move?
Understood. Come again if you change your mind.
Hmm... This Pokémon can learn this move, but your bond of friendship is not yet strong enough. That means I cannot teach it this move.
I see... But there are no Pokémon with you right now that can learn this move.
Which Pokémon should learn this move?
I'm very sorry, but... This Pokémon cannot learn this move.
That's an interesting request, but... Not even I can teach a move to an Egg.
Hmm... It looks like this Pokémon already knows VAR(263, 0).
Drayden: Draco Meteor's power is exceptional, but using it lowers the user's Sp. Atk stat.
Your quest for power has brought you here... Very well. Let me reward your passion with some absolutely astounding moves. They're the ultimate moves! Shall I teach them to your Pokémon?

The Pokémon with you can't learn these moves! Go talk to my wife! Keh!!
Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well. Visit if you have a change of heart.
Well, which Pokémon should I teach?
That Pokémon can't learn a move! Go talk to my wife! Keh!
Teach a move to an Egg? Impossible, even for me! Keh!
The bond with your Pokémon is not strong enough! Keh!
That Pokémon already knows that move! Keh!
I should teach VAR(263, 1) to VAR(257, 0), right? Keh!

Heya! The professor gave you a Pokémon to start your journey, right? If that Pokémon is still with you, and if you two have a strong bond, there's a special move it can learn... Want me to teach it a battle combo move?
A special move... Should I teach it a battle-combo move?
I can't teach these Pokémon.
Is that so... Well, come on back now, y'hear?
Which Pokémon should learn the move?
Now, that Pokémon can't learn this special move! I told ya, it's only for the Pokémon who started your journey with you.
Teach a move to an Egg? What kinda crazy talk is that?!
This Pokémon... Well, it doesn't look like it's too comfortable with you yet.
I can't teach it twice. This Pokémon already knows the special move!
Want me to teach VAR(263, 1) to VAR(257, 0)?
The Pokémon I've taken a shine to are the ones you get from the professor! To teach all of these Pokémon a special move, a battle combo move... That's my pledge!

Cheren: VAR(256, 0)!  I understand the feeling. I want to go somewhere with my Pokémon too, but first we have to go thank Professor Juniper. Come on. The lab is this way!
Cheren: I'm sorry, but could you go to Bianca's house? I'll bet she's spacing out like she usually does. She's totally flighty.
Bianca: ...That's a secret, OK?
Cheren: OK! Let's go meet the professor.
Bianca: Heeey! VAR(256, 0), wait up!
Bianca: Come on! VAR(256, 0), wait up!
Mom: Oh, there you are! And...? What did the professor have to say? She asked you to complete the Pokédex?! I can't believe it!
Well, actually, I can. I already knew she was going to ask.
That's why I brought you three of these Town Maps. Take them with you!
Mom: Here you are, Cheren.
Cheren: I'll take good care of it.
Mom: And one for you, too, Bianca.
Bianca: Th-thank you so much!
Mom: As for your room, VAR(256, 0)-- or what's left of it... No need for any of you to worry. I'll take care of tidying up. OK, VAR(256, 0)?
Mom: Ah, Pokémon. They are so cute, but they have enough power to destroy a bedroom! They are really something. With Pokémon like that at your side, you'll be safe wherever you go!
I'll let your parents know! I hope that, in addition to Pokémon, you'll find lots and lots of places you like in the Unova region-- and become wonderful adults! Have a great trip!
Cheren: If I use the Town Map, I'll always know where I am... That's certainly helpful. Shall we head to Route 1? The professor's waiting.
Bianca: Let's go, let's go! VAR(256, 0), hurry and come too, OK?
Bianca: VAR(256, 0)... It's this way!
Cheren: Bianca says if we're starting a journey together, she wants us all to take our first step at the same time.
Bianca: Hey, VAR(256, 0)! Let's all take our first step on Route 1 together!
Cheren: OK, here we go!

One, two!
The power of science is amazing! Now you can use infrared to do all sorts of things in the blink of an eye!
Do you think traveling with Pokémon changes people?
Me too! Traveling and thinking about many things can definitely make a difference.
You're right! It's fine to just enjoy the journey without overthinking it!
I've heard there are a lot of Pokémon and many different people in the world. When I hear stories about them, I get very excited!

Cheren: If that's the case... I let Ghetsis escape when the Shadow Triad created an opening.
Bianca: ...Ghetsis? The Shadow Triad?
Cheren: I'll tell you later about what happened in the castle. It's more important to ask what you plan to do now, Bianca.
Bianca: You know what? You know what! I'm gonna go to White Forest!
Bianca: You know what? You know what! I'm gonna go to Black City!
Cheren: That's the city on the other side of Route 16 when you leave from Nimbasa City. Hmm. If you go that way, you might be able to meet all sorts of Pokémon you've never seen before.
Cedric: Oh! Well, this is nice timing! I see you're all here!
Just a moment ago, I got some National Pokédex data from an acquaintance. Since you're here, let's upgrade your Pokédex with the National Pokédex data. I'm sure you'll be visiting a wider range of places. Naturally, that means you'll be encountering more Pokémon. Let me see your Pokédex for a sec!
There you go, Bianca!
Next up is Cheren!
And last, but not least...
VAR(256, 0)'s Pokédex was upgraded with the National Mode!
Cedric: You can now switch your Pokédexes to the National Mode Pokédex. Completing the National Pokédex will surely be a big challenge. So, take your time, enjoy yourselves, and meet lots of Pokémon.
Bianca: Wow, the National Pokédex... It looks like there are tons of Pokémon I don't know yet!  Oh! Ooh! I want to show Mom and Dad my Pokédex! I gotta go! Let's meet again somewhere, OK?!
Cheren: Huh. Bianca's as impetuous as ever, no matter what is going on.
I think I'll travel all the way around Unova, starting at Route 1 again. I'm sure I'll discover lots of new things. Could be I'll encounter the Seven Sages along the way... And, VAR(256, 0), if we spy each other along the way, let's battle again, OK?

Cheren: Yes, thank you! Please excuse us. Come on. Let's go thank Professor Juniper.
Cheren: I'll be waiting in front of the Pokémon Research Lab.
Bianca: Oh! Wait! I've gotta go home first.
Thanks for having us over!
Mom: My, my, VAR(256, 0). Pokémon battles are so lively, aren't they? I could hear the Pokémon's cries clear down here!
Hm. That sure reminded me of my first Pokémon battle!
Oh, and you know? After a battle, you need to rest your Pokémon!
Your Pokémon is looking great! Now, if you're going out, don't forget your “cross-transceiver"!
You're going to thank the professor too, right? Better get going, honey!
Mom: Phew! I'm taking a little break from cleaning up. You and your Pokémon should take a break, too. Good Trainers don't push their Pokémon too hard.

Mom: VAR(256, 0), are you being kind to your Pokémon? Pokémon work so hard to help you out! You're normally very kind to your Pokémon, aren't you?
Mom: Now that you mention it... Your father went on a journey with Pokémon, just as you are! We met during his trip...
Mom: How are things going? Have you caught many Pokémon? That was the professor's request, right?
Mom: I wonder what Cheren and Bianca will find during their travels. What they really want from life... If they figure that out for themselves, I think their journeys will prove to be all they could hope for!
Mom: VAR(256, 0)! Welcome home! Sounds like you've been through a lot! You should rest a little bit!
Mom: Oh, my! You and your Pokémon look full of bounce! This is just a little advice from your mother, but... When a Pokémon's energy--um, I mean, HP--runs out, hurry to a Pokémon Center and get it restored. It's also a good idea to buy Potions at a Pokémon Mart for times when you're adventuring far from civilization. Please be careful! Have a good trip! I'll always be cheering for you!
“Mom": Welcome home, VAR(256, 0). Seems like you've been through many amazing things, is it not so?
“Mom": Incredible, really. Amazing, absolutely, meeting these two Pokémon of legend!
“Mom": Ah, ah, this is...
“Mom": Oh! I still wear my disguise! Pardon! Or, rather, let me introduce myself.
I am a globe-trotting elite of the International Police. My name... Ah, no, I shall inform you of my code name only. My code name, it is Looker. It is how I am called!
Looker: Behind the scenes in this region of Unova, an organization called Team Plasma conspires... This I have heard, and therefore, to this region I must come, but...
Thanks to the Gym Leaders and to you, yes, Team Plasma's castle has fallen. And the members, they have gone upon their separate ways! This is what I hear, most certainly!
But, however! However, but... The ones known as the Seven Sages--still, they hide themselves in the Unova region.
And so, in the end, it explains why I must ask this of you, Trainer of amazing skill! Travel the Unova region and search it up and search it down for the Seven Sages! Alder, the Champion of renown, recommended you to my notice. Are you willing to help me?
Ah, ah! Yet once more shall I ask! If you please, travel the Unova region and search it low and high for these Seven Sages!
Looker: Excellent! I thank you! Now I feel as if I have perhaps  a million people on my side. Permit me to give this into your hands!
Mom: ...That's a Super Rod, right?
Looker: Yes, correct! It is certainly a Super Rod!
Mom: Weren't we talking about Team Plasma's Seven Sages? What does this have to do with looking for those people?
Looker: I see. It is truly VAR(256, 0)'s mama to ask so! What a magnificent question! I admire it. It is my pleasure to answer. Absolutely nothing!
...
...
Mom: I see...
Looker: Yes, I shall provide the explanation of this, the Super Rod! First! Face the water and employ the rod! Second! Concentrate your focal point! When it occurs that these Pokémon bite, “!" will indicate. Immediately, reel in! For the rest, VAR(256, 0), I depend upon you!
Mom: People from the International Police are kind of...unique, aren't they? Well, no worries. I think you should just do what you want to do. You're practically a grown-up now!

Cheren: You...are completely hopeless. Here! I'll restore your Pokémon for you.
Cheren healed Bianca's Pokémon!
VAR(256, 0)'s Pokémon needs to be fixed up, too.
Cheren healed VAR(256, 0)'s Pokémon!
Cheren: It's amazing that you won without your Pokémon's losing any energy, which is called HP. But you used some of the moves' Power Points, or PP, though.
Bianca: Hey, Cheren! How about you battle, too? With all you know, I'm sure you can battle without turning the room into a disaster area like I did!
Cheren: I believe you're right! It'll be no problem for me to keep the room from getting any messier. Besides, it's not fair if you two are the only ones who get to have fun battling!




It's decided. You'll be my opponent... in our first Pokémon battle! Let's see what you can do, VAR(257, 1)!

Cheren: I made a strange blunder in my first battle, but this feeling I have... ...I'm finally a Trainer. But first, we'd better go apologize to your mother about this messed-up room.
Cheren: This feeling... Finally, I'm a Trainer. On top of that, we'd better go apologize to your mother about this room.
Bianca: Oh! I'd better come, too!

Bianca: But, I'm... I'm a good Trainer who got a Pokémon and everything! I can totally go on an adventure!
Bianca: Oh... It's OK. ...It's fine! I'll be waiting for you in front of the lab, OK?
Bianca's Dad: What nonsense is this? How could my daughter, who knows nothing about the world, be going on a journey with Pokémon?
Bianca's Mom: Don't mind my husband, dear. He's just being overprotective. All children go on adventures with Pokémon. It's part of growing up.
Bianca's Dad: Well, then. I look forward to the stories Bianca will have for us next time she comes home.
Bianca's Dad: Even if there are many things you want to do, you're only one person. It's frustrating, isn't it?
Bianca's Mom: Choosing one thing means having to give up something else. So, of course it's very hard to decide.
Bianca: I was just looking over my Pokédex again and thinking... I sure have met a lot of different Pokémon.

And you're all finally starting your journeys as Trainers? Well, let me read you a passage from a book called “Adventure Rules." “The X Button is vitally important for Trainers." Never forget that.
Cheren's Mom: That Cheren. I'm sure he's at the laboratory.  He's so... How should I put it? Diligent or, better, conscientious.
Cheren's Dad: Traveling is great! You encounter so many things you've never seen and things you don't yet understand. Wherever you go, you'll learn something new and grow up a little.

Hi there! I've been waiting for you young people! Let me introduce myself again. My name is...
Cheren: Professor Juniper? We know your name.
Professor Juniper: Come, come, Cheren! This is not a time to take things lightly. Today is a day to remember always, so it's best to behave with some formality. That being so, once again, my name is Professor Juniper, and I am researching when and how the creatures called Pokémon came into existence.
Oh, that's unusual! You've already had a Pokémon battle! So maybe that's why... It feels as though your Pokémon have already begun to trust you! By the way, would you like to give your Pokémon a nickname?
Professor Juniper: Uh-huh, I see. Are you OK with the nickname VAR(258, 0)?
Professor Juniper: VAR(258, 0) is its name. That is such a great name!
Professor Juniper: You aren't planning to use a nickname? Well, that's fine, too.
Professor Juniper: As for why I gave all of you Pokémon...
Cheren: It's for the Pokédex, right?
Bianca: Pokédex?
Professor Juniper: I am astonished. Nice work, Cheren! You have already studied Pokémon extensively, haven't you? Still, let me explain everything from the beginning, for everyone's sake.
The Pokédex is a high-tech device that automatically records the Pokémon you encounter! So, I want you three to visit many places and meet all of the Pokémon in the Unova region!
This is my request. VAR(256, 0)! Cheren! Bianca! You'll go on an adventure to complete the Pokédex, will you not?
Professor Juniper: Here is what I need from you! What I want to hear are the courageous words of people who will blaze new paths around the world! I want you three to travel to many distant places and meet all of the Pokémon in the Unova region!
Bianca: OK! I mean... Yes, professor!
Cheren: Thank you very much. Because of you, I can become a Pokémon Trainer, exactly as I've always wished.
Professor Juniper: All of you, thanks! You have given me the best possible answer!
VAR(256, 0) obtained the VAR(65280, 2)PokédexVAR(65280, 0)!
Professor Juniper: Next, I need to teach you how to meet Pokémon. Please meet me at Route 1, OK?
Bianca: S-since the professor asked us, it's OK to go on an adventure, right? I can explore and maybe find out what I want to do in life. I think I'd like that.
Cheren: Of course. We can travel however we want while we complete the Pokédex.
Bianca: For some reason, my heart is pounding, VAR(256, 0). What are you and VAR(257, 1) going to do?
Cheren: Finally, I can become a Pokémon Trainer. I'll have real battles with other Trainers and get stronger. Wait and see!
Professor Juniper: Why, hello, VAR(256, 0)! How have you been lately?
Cedric: Hey, VAR(256, 0)! Are you meeting lots of Pokémon? There really are lots of Pokémon in the Unova region and the rest of the world!



Cedric: Hey, VAR(256, 0)!
Skreet! Skreet!
Bianca: Professor Juniper is letting me help out. When I was looking at my Pokédex, I realized something... I met so many Pokémon during my journey. I just want to learn more and more and more about the little darlings!
Oh yeah! That's right. VAR(256, 0), do you know about massive outbreaks of Pokémon?
Bianca: I knew you'd know, VAR(256, 0)! I'm sure you also know that lots of a certain Pokémon appear in the grass all over, and that if you look at the electric signs in the Route gates, you can see where the mass outbreaks are happening in the Unova region!
Bianca: Tee-hee! OK, then, I'll tell you about it. First of all, lots of a certain Pokémon appear in the grass all over. If you look at the electric signs in the Route gates, you can see where the mass outbreaks are happening in the Unova region! Isn't that amazing!
I have to study lots of Pokémon research, but I don't mind. This is the answer I found during my adventure! It's actually a lot of fun! And I have an idea! Every now and then, come have a Pokémon battle with me, OK? 'Cause by doing that, I'll learn a lot more about Pokémon!
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), did you know this? If you give a Pokémon called Feebas a Prism Scale and trade it with someone, apparently it evolves. Isn't that amazing? Pokémon sure are mysterious beings, aren't they?
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), did you know this? In Pinwheel Forest, there is a rock that's covered in moss. It might be related to the rock, I dunno, but there is a Pokémon that evolves when it levels up in Pinwheel Forest! Pokémon sure are mysterious beings, aren't they?
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), did you know this? Deep in Twist Mountain, there's an ice-covered rock. There is a Pokémon that evolves when it levels up near that rock. Pokémon sure are mysterious beings, aren't they?
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), did you know this? There are Pokémon that evolve when they level up knowing a certain move! Pokémon sure are mysterious beings, aren't they?
Bianca: VAR(256, 0), did you know this? There are Pokémon that evolve when you give them a certain item and they level up at night! Pokémon sure are mysterious beings, aren't they?
Bianca: Oh, VAR(256, 0)! Would you have a Pokémon battle with me today?
Bianca: Great! VAR(256, 0)! We're battling indoors, so don't get too worked up!
Bianca: Whaaaaat! Wait... No, I'm pretty disappointed...
Bianca: Oh, so you will have a Pokémon battle with me, then?
Bianca: Phew! I'm totally sure, VAR(256, 0). You're really a strong Trainer. I love your style of Pokémon battling, VAR(256, 0). Somehow your Pokémon look like they're having so much fun!
Who is this with Professor Juniper? There's a smiling man in the picture.

Professor Juniper: Ah, VAR(256, 0)! There you are! Traveling with your Pokémon is truly one of the joys of being a Trainer! Please follow me. I'd like to show you the most important place for a Trainer to know!
Please listen, everyone. We have something important to talk to you about. Wait here for a moment.
Please excuse me... We are still preparing. If you could continue to be patient...
Please excuse me... We are still preparing. If you could continue to be patient...

Cheren: Wasn't that the professor waiting in front of the Pokémon Center? I know about the Pokémon Center already. Anyway, I want to battle soon! Real battles are the best way to become stronger, you know!
Sounds like something's going on in the plaza!
Well, let's have a little look-see.
Cheren: VAR(256, 0), come here a sec.
My name is Ghetsis. I am here representing Team Plasma. Today, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk to you about Pokémon liberation.
Huh?
What?
Ghetsis: I'm sure most of you believe that we humans and Pokémon are partners that have come to live together because we want and need each other. However... Is that really the truth? Have you ever considered that perhaps we humans... only assume that this is the truth?
Pokémon are subject to the selfish commands of Trainers... They get pushed around when they are our “partners" at work... Can anyone say with confidence that there is no truth in what I'm saying?
Yikes!
No way.
I don't know...
Ghetsis: Now, ladies and gentlemen, Pokémon are different from humans. They are living beings that contain unknown potential. They are living beings from whom we humans have much to learn. Tell me, what is our responsibility toward these wonderful beings called Pokémon?
What could it be?
Liberation?
Ghetsis: That's right! We must liberate the Pokémon! Then, and only then, will humans and Pokémon truly be equals. Everyone, I end my words here today by imploring you to consider the relationship between people and Pokémon... and the correct way to proceed. We sincerely appreciate your attention.
Older Man: About that speech... What do you think we should do?
Younger Man: Liberate Pokémon? That's not even possible!
???: VAR(48649, 1)Your Pokémon... Just now, it was saying...VAR(48649, 0)
Cheren: Slow down. You talk too fast. And what's this about Pokémon...talking? That's an odd thing to say.
???: VAR(48649, 1)Yes, they're talking. Oh. Then, you two can't hear it, either... How sad. My name is N.VAR(48649, 1)
Cheren: My name is Cheren, and this is VAR(256, 0). We were asked to complete the Pokédex, and we just left on our journey. My main goal is to become the Champion, though.
N: VAR(48649, 1)The Pokédex, eh? So... You're going to confine many, many Pokémon in Poké Balls for that, then. I'm a Trainer, too, but I can't help wondering... Are Pokémon really happy that way?VAR(48649, 0)
VAR(48649, 1)Well, VAR(256, 0), is it? Let me hear your Pokémon's voice again!VAR(48649, 0)
N: VAR(48649, 1)As long as Pokémon are confined in Poké Balls... Pokémon will never become perfect beings. I have to change the world for Pokémon, because they're my friends.VAR(48649, 0)
Cheren: Huh... Strange guy. But I'm not going to worry about it. Trainers and Pokémon help each other out! Listen, I'm going on ahead. I want to battle the Gym Leader in the next town--Striaton City. Aim to battle Gym Leader after Gym Leader. The best way for a Trainer to become stronger is to challenge the Gym Leaders in each area.
What's this? You and your Pokémon somehow resemble each other!
Let me give you the benefit of my experience. You listening? The number of Pokémon you can take with you at one time is six!
Pokémon do everything in their power for people. People treat these Pokémon with love and affection. That's what I think our mutual relationship is.
Beautiful scenery and relaxing sounds... Oh, man. I sure do loooove this place. Sure makes me feel happy.
Some wild Pokémon jump out of the tall grass and attack... But you can make friends with those Pokémon if you reach out to them!

Professor Juniper: This is a Pokémon Center! Don't you feel better as soon as you step through the door? OK, let's start your tour!
Bianca: Ooh, wait for me!
Professor Juniper: A Pokémon Center is a truly incredible place! Do you know why? Because your Pokémon can be healed! And, what's more, it's absolutely free! A Pokémon Center is a Trainer's best friend! Here, VAR(256, 0), give it a try.
Professor Juniper: Hey, VAR(256, 0). Where are you off to? Humor me and talk to the lady at the counter. Let her take your Pokémon.
Professor Juniper: You should be talking to the lady at the counter, not to me...
Bianca: All you need to do is give her your Pokémon, VAR(256, 0).
Professor Juniper: OK. Now that your Pokémon have rested, I'll show you how to use the PC at a Pokémon Center.
Professor Juniper: This is the PC. It's free for any Trainer to use. You can store Pokémon in your PC Boxes or select Pokémon stored in your PC Boxes to take along with you. In addition, if you catch a new Pokémon while you have six Pokémon traveling with you, the Pokémon you just caught is sent automatically to the PC network! Surprising, isn't it? Amazing, even. Here's something else that's cool. If you select my PC, I'll evaluate the progress you've made on your Pokédex!
Bianca: Professor... It says “Someone's PC" on the screen. Who is Someone?
Professor Juniper: Very good, Bianca. That's a great observation! Good question, and I'd like to say more, but for now, just ignore that and go ahead and use the PC. “Someone" is the person who made the Pokémon Storage System. ...Someone I'm sure you'll meet someday! OK, let's move on!
Professor Juniper: Now, this is the Poké Mart. This is the place to buy useful items and sell the ones you don't need anymore! That gentleman over there will help you with a smile!
Professor Juniper: So, let's wrap this up. I've given you the basics of being a Trainer! I'm going to head back to Nuvema Town. One final thing... When you get to Striaton City, go and meet an inventor named Fennel. She's a friend of mine from long ago, and I'm sure she'll help you on your way! Best of luck! I hope that your journeys prove to be the adventure of a lifetime!
Bianca: Ooh! What should I buy? Potions and Poké Balls are definitely important. Ummm...thinking...
Be sure to save what's happened up to this point before you forget. Then you can take a break.

It is important to train your Pokémon in battle, but when their HP goes down, take them to a Pokémon Center.
Trainer, how many Poké Balls do you have? If you think you don't have enough, it's a good idea to buy some at a shop in a Pokémon Center!
Oh! Your Pokémon! You're so lucky. I envy you. I want to be a Trainer, too!

Pokémon will be strong if you train them, even if they're weak now. Love is what's important!
If you get strong, you can move forward. If you move forward, you'll be stronger. That's the cool thing about journeys!

Lacunosa Town Methodical and Orderly
Welcome to Lacunosa Town. In this town, people live as methodically as clockwork from morning to night. If you live your life soaking up sunlight, you can sleep very well at night.
Well, hello there, young traveler! Would you like to hear an old story of Lacunosa Town? Bear with me, because I'm an old lady who likes telling tales the old-fashioned way!
There's a great big hole at the back of this town. A long time ago, a huge meteor fell from the sky and made the big hole. A very scary monster was hiding inside the meteor! People say the monster appeared in the village at night, bringing a cold wind, and it stole away people and Pokémon... So the villagers built big walls to keep the monster out and made a rule that no one could go out after dark.
...Of course, nowadays nobody believes in such things. But you know... Even now, the people of this town stay inside after dark. Isn't that strange? I guess old stories and old traditions have some influence on our current life.
Oh, well, that's too bad. Come talk to me if you're ever in the mood for a story!
At night, a scary monster comes out of the big hole, so you have to go home and be good!
Along the road ahead, there is a coastline that fishing fans love. Whirrrrr...plunk! That's the sound my fishing rod makes. I like to hear it every day!
My grandma loves to tell old stories. She makes me listen to her long stories all the time!
There are a lot of people in the world, and there are just as many different characteristics and ideas.
I don't have anything to do ever since I took a post here. Since nobody goes outside at night, it's very peaceful.
Gahoo! Gahoo!
My Pokémon always goes out for fun without me.

Since early times in Sinnoh, people made a bouquet of Gracidea flowers to give someone to show their feelings of appreciation. Isn't that interesting? By giving a Gracidea bouquet, you don't have to say a word, and someone will know how grateful you are. Quite a delightful custom!

Ever since I took a post here, I don't really have anything to do. I'm so bored! I'm afraid all my policing muscles will shrivel up because I don't use them anymore.
My Pokémon always goes out to have fun without me. I wonder where it gets that attitude?
Gahoon! Gahoon!
My work keeps me very busy, and I only go home once a week or so. I'm sorry to leave my wife lonely, but that's the life of a powerful executive. Oh, this is a souvenir from a business trip, but she does not seem to need it, so I will give it to you.

Ah, Cynthia... Why are you so Cynthia...?
Even Maids sometimes have to roost. Oh, I was confused! A Pokémon restores its HP when it uses the move Roost! But for people, it's called resting.
The sunlight is strong... Depending on the Pokémon, that can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. Strong sunlight makes Fire-type moves stronger and Water-type moves weaker.

How are you, Trainer? I won't lose today.
In my father's villa, I have too much time on my hands. Please come for a visit tomorrow, too. I will have a battle with you.
In my father's villa, I have too much time on my hands. Please come for a visit tomorrow, too. I will have a battle with you.
You are as strong as usual. But I wonder what will happen next time.
How are you? I am pleased you came here today, too. May I trouble you for another battle? Let me see... First, please have a battle with my little brother!
None of the Riches is a match for you... I admire your strength!
Oh, it's quite lively for some reason.
I truly appreciate you for having battles with my grandchildren. And now, I'd like to see in what ways your skills exceed theirs.
Hoho! Do you have confidence in winning against me?
Undella Town is a relaxing and comfortable place. But my grandchildren seem somewhat bored. Please come visit us tomorrow, too. My grandchildren will be happy to see you again.
Undella Town is a relaxing and comfortable place. But my grandchildren seem somewhat bored. Please come visit us tomorrow, too. My grandchildren will be happy to see you again.
Ho, ho. You are genuinely strong! You look dependable!
Welcome back, young Trainer. My grandchildren are itching to have more battles with you.
Children of today are very strong in Pokémon battles. Hoho! I wonder if my grandchildren can become Trainers like you?
Hoho! Pokémon battles bring back memories.
I am so excited, my blood is boiling! May I please trouble you for a battle?
I am so excited, my blood is boiling! Please have a battle with me today, too.
Hoho! No matter how old I get, Pokémon battles are fun! This kind of excitement is not bad from time to time! Please come back anytime. Next time, I will win!
Hoho! No matter how old I get, Pokémon battles are fun! This kind of excitement is not bad from time to time!
Hoho! Welcome! Your visit is very exciting!
Hoho! Youth! However, next time won't be like this.
Hoho! Pokémon battles with the entire family! We all had a good time!
What's happening? It's pretty lively.
Trainer, are you strong? Then, try to defeat me!
Today, for sure, I am going to win! Now, try to defeat me!
I may not look like it, but I am very familiar with Pokémon. I would like to have a battle with you someday again.
I may not look like it, but I am very familiar with Pokémon. Please have a battle with me again.
Welcome. Today for sure I'm going to show you the real strength of the Riches!
I didn't expect you to be this strong...
It's a complete defeat... The Riches sincerely wish every success to you in the future.
You! Do you still call yourself one of the Riches?
I am Miles, the next head of the Riches! I will protect the honor of our family!
No matter how often you try,  you cannot defeat me! I will protect the honor of The Riches!
You may come back again tomorrow. However, I have no intention of losing in the name of the Riches.
You came! If you can defeat my family, I will let you have a battle with me.
Sigh. I guess...it's still too early to identify myself as the head of the family.
Sigh. I guess...it's still too early to identify myself as the head of the family. You should be proud of yourself for defeating the distinguished Trainer family, the Riches!

Fun in summer... Beautiful girls playing in the water... Hey! I'm just thinking out loud. Please don't listen to me!
The best luxury is to enjoy just doing nothing.
Phew... I've been relaxing in Undella Town too long, and I've gotten a little chubby. If VAR(257, 0) is by my side, I can get some exercise by training it, and that'll help me lose weight. Would you trade my VAR(257, 1) with VAR(257, 0)?
Phew! All right, let's trade!
Phew... Thanks. Please take good care of VAR(257, 1). It spent a summer with me. I will work hard to train your VAR(257, 0) and get some exercise!
Phew... What I want is VAR(257, 0).
Phew... That's disappointing.
Hello, there! You kindly traded me that Pokémon, and now you can hardly recognize me, eh? Because VAR(257, 0) is by my side, I've trimmed down a little!

===============================
Text File: 455
===============================
We come here for vacation from faraway Hoenn during the summer!
Hoenn is a nice place. For example... Do you know a Trainer named Steven? Although he is reeeally strong, I hear he collects only stones!

===============================
Text File: 456
===============================
???: What's this?
What an uncanny resemblance... It's surprising to meet another Trainer who has intense eyes like that Pokémon Trainer. What's your name? ... OK. I'll remember that! VAR(256, 0), nice to meet you. I'm Cynthia. I'm a Pokémon Trainer, too, like you. I have an insatiable curiosity for researching Pokémon myths.
I'm sure you know about Undella Town's Abyssal Ruins, right? I'm staying here at my friend's villa so I can investigate them.
In order to get to know each other better as Pokémon Trainers, I would like our Pokémon to have a match. Would you care to be my opponent?
Before I send out my Pokémon, my heart always begins to race... Interesting... My Pokémon in their Poké Balls are radiating a happy feeling. Are you the reason? What are you?
Ha ha. You prefer to take things slowly and rationally, am I right? When you're ready, come and talk to me. I'll be happy to see you.
Cynthia: Oh. You've had a chance to get ready? I do want our Pokémon to have a match... Are you prepared to be my opponent?
Cynthia: That was beyond my expectation! What an exceptional battle! You certainly bear a resemblance to that Trainer who faced Giratina... Oh, pardon me. I was just thinking out loud. I love being here in spring and summer. I can't stay all year, because there's so much to investigate in Sinnoh, as well. You're a great Trainer, and it would make me happy to see you again sometime.
Cynthia: I love to come here in spring and summer. But there are a lot of things to investigate in Sinnoh, as well. I'd be delighted to see you again. You're an awesome Pokémon Trainer!
Cynthia: How terrific to see you again! I've got to tell you... My Pokémon are excited to battle yours. Would you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: This will be such fun! No holds barred!
Cynthia: Oh, what a pity. Summers in Undella Town make me feel like I'm on holiday. I forget about battling! But in spring, I feel like getting worked up with a good battle.
Cynthia: I can tell that my Pokémon are excited about battling your Pokémon... Would you care to be my opponent?
Cynthia: For some reason, this reminds me of a time when I told a Trainer like you to go see many, many more places and to meet many more Pokémon. For me, it has really been worthwhile to come all the way to far Unova. Why? Because... I met you, and my world got wider!
Cynthia: To live their lives to the fullest, people and Pokémon need the chance to throw themselves into battle against the fiercest opposition. That's why I want to battle you. How about it?
Cynthia: As our Pokémon meet in battle, I'll learn more about you and how you've taken care of them.
Cynthia: I'm a little disappointed. I know you can battle on bigger stages than you've done so far! It's so plain to me that your light can shine brighter than this...
Cynthia: Are you prepared? Let's battle at full strength and see how bright our lights can shine!
Cynthia: When you meet Trainers, battle them to learn about the kind of people they are. Observe the Pokémon they choose, which moves they taught them, and which items the Pokémon hold. You don't need words at such times... If you want to know more about me... Come to Sinnoh!
Caitlin: Having everything go your way is the road to disillusionment. Knowing the difference between what's impossible and what's possible... I used to know someone who  talked about that a lot.
Caitlin: No matter how hard I try, I cannot defeat Cynthia. Before, I would have exploded with rage. Now, I have the tranquility to reflect on my performance to see how I can improve.
Caitlin: Tell me something. Are you familiar with Battle Castles? You can find them in Johto and Sinnoh, so challenge them to improve yourself.
Caitlin: This is my villa. I have villas all over the world, and I allow Cynthia to use them. You are welcome to come and play whenever you wish.
Caitlin: Having no psychic powers at all is better than having psychic powers you can't control.
Shauntal: When I'm writing novels, if I don't have enough input, my output suffers. It's the same thing for Trainers. To grow stronger, Trainers need to have countless battles and learn many things. Then, they must put what they've learned to the test in real battles.
Shauntal: Rainbow Wing... Silver Wing... They stir the imagination!
Shauntal: Distortion World... and the single Pokémon found there... What an amazing scene!
Shauntal: No matter how much research I do, I still have no clue. How old do you think Cynthia is? Any idea?
Shauntal: I chose my scarf with a certain Pokémon in mind. Do you get it? Using your imagination is important!
Cynthia: What is necessary for becoming stronger than you are now? My answer is simply loving Pokémon with all your heart. That's how I am, so that's all I can say.
Cynthia: Once every few years, the Champions of each region gather and compete to see who is the strongest! An interesting idea, don't you agree?
Cynthia: I'd love to live here... But if I did, there would be a mountain of research materials piled up... Am I right? Cynthia, enough for now! Next time, clean up.
Cynthia: Here's my problem. I have a white swimsuit and a black swimsuit... Which one would look better on me?
Cynthia: Hmm. This is difficult. I was greedy and brought a lot of swimsuits, but now I can't pick which one to wear.
Iris: Oh, hey! Did you see Cynthia's Garchomp? It's too cute!
Iris: Soon, Drayden and I are going to ride the cruise ship! Castelia City is wall-to-wall people, but if I'm with him, I'll be OK!
Iris: Sometimes I think about the village where I was born, but I'm totally OK! Because I met lots of Pokémon-- and all of you!
Iris: Look! Look! It's the ocean!
Iris: The ocean is so pretty. I love it! So I stayed underwater a long time. I made everyone worry!
Skyla: I get along well with Elesa, but Pokémon battles are a different story! If you're not super prepared, your battles with Electric types will leave you in shock!
Skyla: Seeing the ground again after safely passing through a rain cloud in a violent rainstorm... Someday, I'd like to share that moment with you.
Skyla: I was just thinking about that. When it comes to swimsuits... You're either about self-composure or you're about self-exposure!
Skyla: Even distant Sinnoh is just a hop, skip, and a jump if I use my cargo plane. But... I also love to travel the sky with a Pokémon when it's using Fly!
Skyla: Mmm... Swimming in the ocean sure feels great!
Elesa: I must say it's difficult for people to draw out a Pokémon's charm if they don't have any themselves.
Elesa: You know Nimbasa City? You know it runs on energy generated by Electric-type Pokémon? ...Just kidding!
Elesa: Getting wrapped up in worries is bad for your body and spirit. That's when you must short out your logic circuits and reboot your heart.
Elesa: Without a word... Without even a whisper... My Pokémon connect me to other Trainers, transmitting the current of my feelings.
Elesa: Put bluntly,  swimsuits are nothing but cloth, right?
Lenora: Aren't Fossils amazing? Although they are not alive and cannot speak, they tell us so much about the era in which they lived. Hee, hee. It was Professor Juniper who said that.
Lenora: TMs can be used as many times as you wish, to be sure. If you teach Retaliate to many different Pokémon, eventually you should find the perfect Pokémon for it!
Lenora: When I was a little girl, my dad, who was a miner, would always bring back bones for me. My young heart was captured by bones! Before I knew it, I was a researcher.
Lenora: Recently, a girl named Bianca came to ask me about Pokémon. A Trainer's curiosity is insatiable at any stage.
Lenora: Cynthia is a famous archeologist. In the course of our research, we have shared many academic conversations.

A beautiful tune is spreading throughout the town...
Anville Town Rolling Out the Steel Rails
It's a subway map of the Unova region.
Oh, are you also curious about that train?
Unfortunately, no train has come here today.
See the train there?
All righty! Let me explain!
All righty! All aboard!
Oh, that's a shame.
Hahaha! You're right.
Today's train car is a Hyperspeed Train! It runs faster than a rocket! It runs quieter than an air conditioner!
This is a Single Train! It's the oldest train in the Battle Subway.
This Super Single Train is a new mass-produced car!
This car is a Double Train! This is a mass-produced car from a decade ago!
This Super Double Train is a new mass-produced car!
This car is a Multi Train! Few cars of this model were produced.
This train car is a Super Multi Train! This is the latest train car!
This train car is a Wi-Fi Train! It is the fastest long-distance high-speed train in the Battle Subway!
As you know, this is a local train to Anville Town! Isn't it just so cute?
This train car is the kind that ran a long time ago.
This train car is a new train to run in the future!
I can see! I can see it! That lovely smooth curve! Ah, I wish I could reach out and touch it!
It's for a loop line to go around the Unova region!
It's an environmentally friendly train, because they revised all the parts to drastically reduce power consumption!
Compared to a Single Train, the number of parts was reduced so it could be built for a lower cost.
Such a streamlined and refined design! Beauty and utility working together! That kind of beautility is unique to mass-produced train cars!
This is a test car to develop future mass-produced cars that will replace the old Double Trains.
Improved acceleration and deceleration! Automated train-car controls! It's full of cutting-edge technologies.
This is called a pendulum car. Its body tilts while going around curves, so it can run without slowing down!
This one is a little slow and heavy. When it runs, the whole train sways.
Compared to contemporary train cars, it has more parts, so I heard it was difficult to build.
Wooo! Cool! Super cool! The latest motor breathes fire!
I can see it so clearly! But I cannot touch the Hyperspeed Train! It really is hyper technology! As you can see, we engineers are always seriously dreaming that someday the dream will become a reality!
Do you know Tubeline Bridge? The train that runs on it is this Single Train.
Newer trains have to be built in a way that's both functional and environmentally friendly. Compared to the past, they've improved significantly.
The number of parts influences the budget and construction time. The streamlined and beautiful design of the Double Train is still valued today.
It uses the same train car as a Super Single Train. The only difference is the appearance. It is a superb train car that will go down in the history of the Battle Subway!
The technology born during the creation of this train car made the Super Single Train and Super Double Train possible!
Also, a regeneration brake system, a car-body tilting system, a whatchamacallit system, a thingamabob system... I don't remember all the details, but it's just a big festival of all the latest technology!
Faster! Farther! Our engineers' spirits are infused in it!
The train car is the same model as a Single Train. Because it is an old train car, I hear the maintenance is hard, but it's the one I always ride, because I loved it as a kid!
The old train cars built with lots of small parts have their own unique beauty and attract a lot of fans. Those cars no longer run in the Battle Subway, but I hear they're still used in a faraway region. Ah... I'd love to be on that train!
Uh-oh, if it really breathed fire, that would be bad! But it is full of the latest technologies! It's undergoing a lot of testing. It's called a gauge-convertible train. It's a sweet car that can adjust its wheels to run on any rail!
A train to Nimbasa City is leaving the station shortly. Would you like to board?
Then, please get on the train and wait.
This is a quiet town! Relax and stay for a while.
Gave the VAR(265, 0) in exchange for the VAR(265, 2)!
Ah... I'm in trouble. I was so engrossed in my trip that I ran out of VAR(265, 0). Let me see... Will you trade your VAR(513, 1) VAR(265, 0) for my VAR(513, 3) VAR(265, 2)?
Will you trade your VAR(513, 1) VAR(265, 0) for my VAR(513, 3) VAR(265, 2)?
Great, let's trade!
Oh, that's a shame.
Hehe! It was a delightful trade, wasn't it?
...Uh-oh. You don't have enough VAR(265, 0)s.
...Uh-oh. You don't have enough room for the VAR(265, 2).
I am a VAR(265, 0) collector! You, over there! Let's have a businesslike exchange. Will you trade your VAR(513, 1) VAR(265, 0) for my VAR(513, 3) VAR(265, 2)?
Will you trade your VAR(513, 1) VAR(265, 0) for my VAR(513, 3) VAR(265, 2)?
Excellent. Let's do business!
Why? Do you think this is a bad deal?
Hah! It was a mutually beneficial trade! This is a win-win relationship, right?
Hah! You don't have any VAR(265, 0)s.
Hah! You don't have enough room for the VAR(265, 2).
With that face, I bet you have something I want. Will you trade your VAR(513, 1) VAR(265, 0) for my VAR(513, 3) VAR(265, 2)?
Will you trade your VAR(513, 1) VAR(265, 0) for my VAR(513, 3) VAR(265, 2)?
Yay! Then, let's trade!
Oh, it seems I was mistaken...
Ooh-la-la! This luster! I really like VAR(265, 0)s. An experienced person like me can tell the difference of the luster of each one!
Ooh-la-la! You don't have enough VAR(265, 0)s.
Ooh-la-la! You don't have room for the VAR(265, 2).
It's so lively on weekends! Oh, me? I came here to watch the trains.
You can trade lots of items. It was surprisingly fun when I tried!
What delicious air!
I wanted to get a picture from this angle!
Why do people love trains? Maybe it's the design, the way they can run so fast and still be so comfortable. All the essential parts work together... It's simple but so beautiful!
Trains are so cooooool! My mom brought me, but now she's taking pictures somewhere.
On weekends, a lot of people come here to watch the trains.
They are full of people today, too. Do you also trade items?
This is a rare weekend when there aren't any trains.
A lot of train cars have a rest here.
If there are a lot of people, I feel that the trains are happy!
Today all the train cars are resting!
The girl on the bridge... She's playing a lullaby for all the sleeping trains of this town.

===============================
Text File: 458
===============================
Anville Town is famous for its turntable. You saw it from the bridge, right?
Lots of people ride on trains, right? So the people who drive the trains and the people who maintain them have a big responsibility!

===============================
Text File: 459
===============================
If you come out on the weekends to watch the trains, there will be a lot of people.
On the weekends, many VAR(265, 0) collectors gather here. It must be easier for them to collect their items because many people who are trading different items come here.

===============================
Text File: 460
===============================
Oh ho! With a face like that, I'll bet you're a Pokémon Trainer! I work as a Depot Agent on the Battle Subway! Have you tried challenging the Battle Subway yet? It's a hot spot for those who want some serious battling action! But some people get too wrapped up in their battles, and there's no end to the lost-and-found items. That's right. Nobody ever came to pick this up, so I'll give it to you!
I have a lost-and-found item that no one has claimed. If you don't mind, could you take it off my hands?
Oh! I've been waiting for you! Recently, we've gotten more passengers, so there's more lost-and-found items! No one has claimed this, so if you don't mind, could you take it off my hands?
No worries. No worries. Just take it! It's better for a Trainer to use it than for me to hold on to it. I'm sure the item is happier, too!
If I have another lost-and-found item, come get it, OK? Also, if you're interested, take on the Battle Subway in Nimbasa City!
Oh, my. There's no more room for the VAR(265, 0). You'll need to remove some from your Bag before you can accept any more!

I will judge your battles in a Battle Test! What would you like to do?

And what do you think she said to me? “What? I work with you every day. You're not serious, right?" IYA! It was an all-prettied-up Azusa! SHIMATAAAA! So, that's it for today's “KOUKAN TALK!" ...I sure hope Azusa will start talking to me again soon!

Toru: YA, MINNA! In today's “KOUKAN TALK," I'm going to introduce something that's often said to me. “You're kidding!" There is often a lot of shocking news in my circle of friends.

Just declare victory like that, and your opponent might get scared and run away! So that's it for today! Let's meet again! JA NE!
Toru: KONNICHI-HELLO! It's “KOUKAN TALK," which gives you great tips for talking in Japanese! Today's phrase is this! “What was that about!?"

I-shee-tsu-bu-te! “Ishi" means rock, and “tsubute" is like a throwing stone. Don't try to throw a Geodude, though, because you will probably get hurt! OK, see you next week! Farewell!
Host: Welcome to “PokéQuiz," where we quiz kids who love Pokémon, but don't like language lessons, on the Japanese names of Pokémon! Today's Pokémon is Wailord! OK, what is it called in Japanese? OK, you three kids there with the confident expressions! Quill: Oh! It's Wailord! Ill: I know! It's Ohwhale! Zill: Oh yeah! It's Ohwell! Host: Oh! That's incorrect! The correct answer is Whaloh! It's pronounced: ho-e-ru-o-o! “Hoeru" means “wail," and the “oh" at the end means “king." Maybe it's sad and lonely at the top! Has a very noble sound to it, doesn't it? OK, see you next week!
Host: Welcome to “PokéQuiz," where we quiz kids who love Pokémon, but don't like language lessons, on the Japanese names of Pokémon! Today's Pokémon is Machop! What is it called in Japanese? The hint is, “riki" means strength in Japanese. OK, you three over there! Your answers please! Quill: Oh! It's Machop! Ill: I know! It's Mabrarian! Zill: Oh yeah! It's Chopchop! Host: Sorry, that's incorrect! The correct answer is Wanriky! Wa-n-ri-kee! “Wan" means “arm," and “riki" means “strength." It's very easy to understand! Well then, everyone, farewell! Mah-mah-machooo!
Host: Welcome to “PokéQuiz," where we quiz kids who love Pokémon, but don't like language lessons, on the Japanese names of Pokémon! Today's Pokémon is Beautifly! What is it called in Japanese? OK, you three over there! Quill: Oh! It's Beautifly! Ill: I know! It's Flybeauti! Zill: Oh yeah! It's Flyfly! Host: Nope, the correct answer is Agehunt! A-ge-ha-n-to! The “hunt" part makes it sound ferocious for such a pretty Pokémon. OK, see you next week! Farewell!
Narrator: It's time for “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce an energetic little one. The Pokémon of this new Trainer who is running around Route 2 energetically is the Lillipup called Ran! Its Trainer heads for Route 2 with Ran every day. Ran has never lost a battle there, and it refuses to lose to any Pokémon! It's running around the tall grass with its owner today as well! That was Ran, who is very energetic, but not as much as my li'l Lillipup! On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce another fantastic Pokémon...who is great, but not quite as great as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a helpful little one! In a two-story home in Striaton City, the Patrat called Peeps lives with its Trainer. Its Trainer is also a Pokémon Breeder who is raising many Pokémon! And when its Trainer is really busy, Peeps lends a hand...or a paw! It plays with all the other Pokémon to give them some exercise and sometimes even gets them to settle down for the night. Today, Peeps has started a lively game of tag with some of the other Pokémon its Trainer is taking care of. They'll sleep well tonight after all that running! That was the Patrat Peeps, who is helpful, but not as much as my Patrat. On the next “Your Pokémon," we will meet another Pokémon who works hard, but not as hard as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a hard-working little one! In Nacrene City's old warehouses, the Purrloin Meg lives with its Trainer. Meg's Trainer runs a store, and every morning, Meg goes to work with her. At the store, Meg is its Trainer's partner! It sits outside as a mascot and draws customers into the store. Today, it's even carrying a sign for the store to attract even more customers! That was the Purrloin Meg, who works hard, but not as hard as my Purrloin. On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a little Pokémon with a lot of fighting spirit, but not as much as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a little one with a great fighting spirit! In a Castelia City office building, a Darumaka named Gance is having a Pokémon battle. Its Trainer is a Clerk ⑭ who works in the building. This company takes Pokémon battles very seriously. In fact, work schedules, meeting agendas, and other important matters are all decided by battles! And so its Trainer won't have to work on weekends or do really boring jobs, Gance does its very best in every battle. The Darumaka Gance is a Pokémon with fighting spirit, but not as much as my Darumaka! On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that stands out, but not as much as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a little one that stands out! It's waiting in the wings in the Nimbasa City Musical for its cue to go on stage. This Minccino is named Julie! Julie and its Trainer have put so much effort into training for the Musical. They've worked really hard! And for Julie, the goal every day is to be the one that gets the most time in the spotlight! Julie and its Trainer have a real fire in their hearts when it comes to performing! That was the Minccino Julie, who stands out, just not as much as my Minccino. On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that's really good at napping, but not as good as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a very relaxed little one! In a small house in Driftveil City, the Cubchoo named Kodie lives with its Trainer. Kodie's Trainer is a Worker in the Cold Storage. Kodie tags along to work and takes a nap right there in the Cold Storage. Even when it's cold enough that its Trainer's teeth are chattering, Kodie naps away in perfect comfort! That was Kodie, who's very relaxed, but not as relaxed as my Cubchoo! On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that is patient, but not as patient as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a very patient little one! In Mistralton City, a Crustle called Amine spends a lot of time at the Cargo Plane Center. You see, Amine's Trainer is a Pilot! He often flies overseas for work, and Amine doesn't always know when he will return. So Amine waits at the Cargo Plane Center and watches the sky for its Trainer's plane. That was the Crustle Amine, which is patient, but not as patient as my Crustle. On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that is an excellent judge, but not as good as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a little one with excellent judgment. In a stone home in Icirrus City, the Swoobat named Amour lives with its family. When there is an argument in the family, they ask Amour to settle it! Should we go to the mountain or stream? Should dinner be vegetables or Berries? Amour listens to everyone's side and makes a careful judgment. That was the Swoobat Amour, who has excellent judgment skills, but not as good as my Swoobat's! On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that eats a lot, but not as much as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a little one that loves to eat! Near the gate of Opelucid City, the Zweilous Chow lives with its Trainer. Both Chow and its Trainer really love to eat! Anything you serve them, they'll gobble it right up. They even compete against each other in eating contests. Back when Chow was a Deino, its Trainer could eat faster...but now that Chow has evolved into a Zweilous, it has an extra mouth, so that's a big advantage! It's built up quite a winning streak with its two hungry hungry heads. That was the Zweilous, Chow, who eats a lot, but not as much as my Zweilous. On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that is amazing... but, of course, not as amazing as mine!
Narrator: It's “Your Pokémon"! On today's “Your Pokémon," we will introduce an amazing little one! Deep in Victory Road, the Throh Heishi is fighting with its Trainer, a Black Belt. But don't worry, they're just training! The Trainer beat Heishi in a judo match the first time they met. That's how they became friends. After a long, hard journey, they've finally arrived at Victory Road. Heishi's Trainer wants to become Champion, of course...and Heishi's dream is to beat the Champion in a judo match! That was the Throh Heishi, who is amazing, but not as amazing as my Throh. On the next “Your Pokémon," we will introduce a Pokémon that is energetic, but not as energetic as mine!

“Unova News": Next, we have an interview with Ms. A, who was stranded on a snowy mountain for three days before she was found in a town in the foothills. Ms. A: It was definitely Cubchoo! Just when I was out of strength and about to fall asleep, I saw it! It was the shadow of something living, and the next day I woke up in this town in the foothills. The people in this town say I got here by myself, but it was definitely because of Cubchoo! I'm sure it saved me! “Unova News": This concludes the interview with Ms. A.
“Unova News": Next up, a column in Gear Station is said to have moved on its own. We have an interview with Mr. B, the only witness. Mr. B: Yup, I done seen it! All of tha sudden I done heard a noise like klink klink klink, and then... rrrwrrrwrrrwrrrBOOM! And the column spun right 'round! Then, when I heard that klink-klinkin' again and looked up, something that looked kinda like a little gear went a-flyin' away. I'm shore it was that little feller's doin'. It was one of them there Pokey-mon. Shore was. “Unova News": That concludes our interview with Mr. B.
“Unova News": This is so exciting! We're speaking to a woman who actually saw a living ice-cream cone! Ms. C: I wanted a Casteliacone no matter what, and I came all the way in from the countryside to get one. Then, I waited in a looong line and finally bought the ice cream. When I was just about to take a nibble, the ice cream moved! It startled me, so I dropped it, and it ran away! Could that have been a Pokémon? “Unova News": That concludes our interview with Ms. C.
“Unova News": Next up, we have news of a Pokémon that can see the future. Ms. D: I was elegantly strolling along the beach. Then I saw a Pokémon off in the distance. It was looking intently in my direction for some reason. It just sat there staring, so at first, I thought it was looking at me, but... It suddenly pointed to the ocean and disappeared! I wanted to know what it was pointing at, so I walked toward the ocean... And then! A big boulder fell down from the cliff above! Right where I had just been standing! I'm sure that Pokémon can see the future! There's no doubt about it! It protected the future of a beautiful lady like me. “Unova News": ...Uh-huh. This concludes the report on Ms. D.

It feels so peaceful here. I love it!
When you're surrounded by trees, you feel like your entire being has become one with nature.
City life seems like it would be really nerve racking...
Fresh air! A comfortable breeze. Mmmm... This place has everything.
No surprises, no stress-- that is the secret of a good life!
Pokémon are the same! They prefer to live in a natural setting, too.
Here, everyone is pleasant and kind to everyone else. I want to work with everyone for the sake of this incredible forest!
The force of nature commands our respect. The force of nature is what supports all life. Nature's bounty brings us so much goodness. Nature's power surpasses imitation!
Leo: Hello there! Ah... Doesn't it feel terrific to enjoy the beauties of nature? I'm Leo. I come from the Black City VAR(256, 0) visited. Nice to meet you!
Leo: Hello there! Today, I woke up to the pleasant rustling of leaves in the wind. This place is so relaxing!
Recently, I've been feeling a certain... Hm, I don't know... ...Maybe I'm craving the city lights.
Guess what? Check this out! A Pidgey was eating food in the grass right over there!
Silvia: Why, hello! Isn't this place sublime? The air is so fresh. It's all so tranquil. I'm Silvia. I'm from the Black City VAR(256, 0) visited. It's a pleasure to meet you!
Silvia: Even if I take off my glasses, I'll know exactly where I am. What tells me is the lush greenery all around.
You know, the time I spend here is lovely, but something's missing... That's how I feel.
If my triple-strength glasses don't lie, I met a little Wurmple-kins in a spot just ahead of here! This is a special place... So serene!
Dave: 'Sup! Call me Dave! I used to mix it up a lot with VAR(256, 0) in Black City! Nice meetin' ya! I feel like this place is bold enough to take in a tough guy like me!
Dave: 'Sup! I've got it goin' on today! Listen up! I'm gonna spread the word about all the awesome things about nature! With a fierceness!
What can I say? White Forest is too dull. It doesn't have enough hustle and bustle to keep a guy like me interested.
Aaaaaaaeeeeeeeek! Is that a Gastly over there? Oh, whew. It's just your shadow. But I have seen a Gastly recently.
Britney: I'm VAR(256, 0)'s friend Britney. I'm used to living on the edge in Black City!
Britney: We're up to our ears in nature here. It sure winds you down. Couldn't be more different from the freewheelin' life in Black City!
Hmm. Now that I've started to think about it, I miss being wild and free in Black City.
Are you searching for Hoppip? No problem! I saw one! Run through the tall grass and catch it!
Robbie: I'm Robbie from Black City, where VAR(256, 0) passed through! Nice to meet you! You know what? I'd never imagined a place like this really existed. It's nothing but green as far as the eye can see! I'm shocked!
Robbie: I was in Black City because I'm fascinated by architecture, but being in a forest is pretty nice, too!
Ohhhhhhh, am I bored! So bored! I want to go back to Black City!
Oh! You'll never guess! Elekid! I saw an Elekid running off that way! Maybe I should chase it!
Miki: Hello! My name's Miki! Nice to meet you! I battled VAR(256, 0) in Black City! Super tough!
Miki: Ahhh, mmm... This place is soothing. I read somewhere that the scent of trees and grass makes you feel calm, in an aromatherapy kind of way. This place seems to have the same effect!
Gosh. Maybe I've become too calm... 'Cause I'm bored now! But that's worth feeling, too, from time to time.
Wait, what? A Togepi just ran behind you right now!
Ryder: Take a deep breath! The air here is so pure and wonderful! I'm Ryder. I'm from the Black City, where VAR(256, 0) visited. Good to meet you.
Ryder: Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! When the air is this fresh, it gives you extra power for training! But it is a bit of a problem not to have a sparring partner!
Hyah... Hyah? Hyah? I've been having trouble lately getting into my training... Maybe Black City suits me better... 
When I was practicing forehand strikes with my Pokémon, a Machop was watching us in envy. Why don't you go look for it?
Karenna: I got here from Black City as fast as I could! I'm impressed by how VAR(256, 0) fights, and I know I still have a long way to go!
Karenna: Keep going! Yeah! My Pokémon and I are running!
Phew... I'm tired of running! Time for another battle! For that, back to Black City!
Oh. Are you going to run with me? I just saw a wild Slakoth. If we go running, maybe you'll meet it.
Doug: Hello, hello! I'm Doug!! I came from Black City. I'm an acquaintance of VAR(256, 0). Now, there's someone who has furious Pokémon battles!
Doug: When I'm surrounded by nature, I work! It's coming along pretty well!
So, I've had a lot of fresh air, and I think I'm well refreshed! I have a lot of other work to do, so I want to go to Black City.
Recently, I saw a Shinx in this area! Yes, just being here refreshes me!
Vincent: Hey, how are you? In Black City, I was VAR(256, 0)'s sparring partner. Not too bad of a Trainer, I'd say, but not as strong as I am.
Vincent: The vastness of nature spices up my life! Yeah, I really have taken a liking to this place.
Well, you know, I was born and raised in the city, so maybe I should go home soon.
Recently a Magby was staring at me from over there! It ran as soon as our gazes met. If it likes me, it should let me know!
Marie: The oxygen is so rich! Just like VAR(256, 0) said! In a place like this, I'm sure I can focus and write my paper!
Marie: Fresh air and a good paper... Once I write it, I'll present it in Black City!
I'm good and refreshed, so I want to go back to Black City.
A few seconds ago, when I was doing some deep-breathing exercises, I saw a Magnemite imitating me! It made me laugh.
Lena: VAR(256, 0)...? Sorry. You look like someone I know... A person I met in Black City and had a Pokémon battle with...
Lena: The plants grow thick and green with the blessing of the soil. I want to be thankful for this as I walk.
People are drawn to man-made things. I miss Black City...
It's so peaceful here. I love listening to the Grass-type Pokémon breathing and the bird Pokémon chirping... Did you notice? A Ralts just ran past right behind you.
Carlos: Oh! Hello! There is so much to see here! I just came from Black City, where I met a Trainer named VAR(256, 0) who was very strong. It was fun!
Carlos: Oh! Hello! I've traveled in many places, but places this close to nature are very rare!
But, hmmm... I think it's about time to head somewhere else.
Starly! Starly was just there! Why don't you go look for it?
Molly: So this is White Forest! It's very different from Black City! Hey, do you know a Trainer named VAR(256, 0) who is really strong?
Molly: I've been traveling, and I've seen a lot of places, but I have never seen a place this pretty before!
This is a pretty place, but maybe a little boring...
Oh, that's right! An Azurill was running happily toward the grass! Maybe I should run with the Pokémon in the grass!
Frederic: VAR(256, 0)?! ...Oh! My mistake! I'm very frustrated at losing our Pokémon battle, so I want a rematch the next time I see that Trainer.
Frederic: Oh... Have a look at this! My Pokémon is so happy! Pokémon love nature, but... I'm the complete opposite!
Well, my Pokémon is having fun, but I'm starving for some excitement.
Just a second ago, my Pokémon was playing with a wild Budew. It ran away when it saw me, but it really looked like it was having fun!
Lynette: How are you? I was in Black City, and I got to battle VAR(256, 0), who was really strong! It was wonderful.
Lynette: This environment with nothing but nature is nice, too. It's soothing.
But I'm a little tired of being out in the countryside. I want to spend time in a place where there is more stuff.
I saw an Oddish today! I haven't really seen one before, so I was fascinated!
Pierce: Until recently, I was in Black City. I also battled with VAR(256, 0) there. I suspect VAR(256, 0) likes White Forest more than you might suspect.
Pierce: Living simply among nature and enjoying your own life... I think that is not a bad way to live.
Hmmm... But I might be getting tired of the slow life...
Today, I saw a Mareep! That's something you could only see in White Forest!
Gene: Nature is great! But I remember Black City sometimes. My battle with VAR(256, 0) is an important memory!
Gene: My hobby is meeting Pokémon in their natural habitat!
But recently, I've been thinking I want to test the strength of the Pokémon I've met.
I met an Aron today! It was really lucky! White Forest definitely fits me like a glove!
Piper: The natural surroundings here are very comfortable. Until recently, I was in Black City, and VAR(256, 0)'s battling style was fairly efficient.
Piper: Leisurely time passed together with Pokémon... Things like that are important.
But recently, for some reason, leisurely passing time like this makes me feel a little impatient.
I spent today with a Bellsprout! It was a precious experience!
Miho: Pokémon in White Forest are so adorable! But VAR(256, 0), who I met in Black City, was pretty cute too!
Miho: Pokémon and this expansive nature! Everyone is in their natural state, and I think it's wonderful!
But I might need a little more than just nature. I have to find more things I want to do!
In nature, Seedot and people can become friends... That sure is a wonderful thing, isn't it?
Shane: Everyone is very honest in White Forest. I wonder if VAR(256, 0), who I just met in Black City, will like White Forest more than you might expect.
Shane: Here both Pokémon and people can just be themselves.
But I'm worried about how this more honest me will be seen.
I just saw a Rhyhorn over there! A Rhyhorn in its natural state... Wow!
Ralph: In White Forest, it's fun how people and Pokémon can deal with one another directly. Before, in Black City, I battled VAR(256, 0), and we were able to show each other how we felt! That was fun, too!
Ralph: I want Pokémon and people to be able to face each other directly and understand one another.
But I also think I want to promptly be able to show people how I feel!
I met a Lotad over there today! We communicated our feelings to each other, and I'm still awed by the memory.
Eliza: A lifestyle where you encounter nature is fulfilling. But when I had a Pokémon battle with VAR(256, 0) in Black City, something about that made me feel fulfilled, too.
Eliza: When you encounter nature, your heart becomes that much richer.
But... Just looking at nature doesn't fulfill your spirit. That's what I've been thinking recently.
I saw a Trapinch, and it made my heart happy.
Collin: My success story begins here! In Black City, I had a rival named VAR(256, 0), but I don't have one here! I'm going to make a fortune!
Collin: I like how everyone here looks so happy! I want to make them even happier with my business!
Business opportunities don't just come rolling at you so easily. Ahh... I feel like Black City may be a better fit for me...
Successful people are always looking up! So I was looking up while I was walking, and I accidentally walked into an Abra. Sorry, Abra!
Ken: I feel that I've grown as a Trainer who can look at Pokémon with a broad mindset. I wonder how VAR(256, 0), who I met in Black City, is doing these days.
Ken: Studying many different Pokémon and gaining a lot of far-reaching knowledge widens your world.
But now I'm thinking I'd rather think about just one thing very deeply.
When you have a broad mindset, you notice things about nature and yourself and about yourself and Pokémon. I thought that when I saw a Nidoran⑭ over there recently.
Jacques: When you see how many different Pokémon there are in the world, you understand there are lots of different answers to problems, too. When I met VAR(256, 0) in Black City, I felt that Trainer’s way of thinking was one of those answers.
Jacques: Several different answers exist for each problem. Watching different Pokémon makes me feel that way.
But I want to study something with a more clear, definite answer...
A variety of Pokémon, a variety of answers. All of them equally valid. I thought that when I saw a Nidoran⑮ over there recently.
Rosa: Here, you can feel growth from day to day. Before, in Black City, when I battled VAR(256, 0), I thought I hadn't grown at all.
Rosa: Watching the growth of nature lets you feel some kind of growth every day.
Well, that may be true, but just watching nature gets boring sometimes. I don't have anything to do.
Every day of being alive means many small changes that give the day meaning. I thought that when I saw a Whismur recently.
Herman: I've settled in here now, but before, when I lived in Black City... Pokémon battles with VAR(256, 0) sure were fun!
Herman: Living here, surrounded by nature, is very calming.
But it's not like me to stay in one place forever.
Oh yeah... I just saw a Porygon! So strange to see one here... It must have taken a liking to the forest. I want to live the slow life here, too!
Emi: Right now, I'm on a leisurely journey, but before that, I had a goal: to win against VAR(256, 0) in Black City.
Emi: It's fun to travel as you like, with no particular goal in mind.
But maybe it's better to have at least some idea of where you're going?
In my travels through this forest, I met a Happiny! I was so happy!
Grace: The beauty of the Pokémon battle I had with VAR(256, 0) in Black City can stand up to the beauty of nature!
Grace: The beauty created by nature... Its grandness exceeds human imagination.
The beauty I want to see right now is the artistry of human hands. I can't satisfy that craving here.

Ho! Hoo! Welcome to White Forest! In White Forest, people live in harmony with nature and with Pokémon. Please listen to the voice of the forest. It's saying “Bienvenue!" Ho! Hoo! Hoo!
I do research into the Pokémon that live in this forest. In theory, you should find VAR(257, 0) living in this forest.
Hoo! That's VAR(257, 0)! So it lives in this forest, too!
What's more, you caught it today! Ho hoo! This means there are VAR(257, 0) in White Forest. For you, my skilled Pokémon catcher-- this small trifle. Hoo!
If you return here tomorrow, I'm sure the forest will say “Bienvenue" again!
Thank you very much for today. See you again tomorrow! The forest is murmuring, “À très vite!"
I'm researching the Pokémon that live in this forest. Hoo! But there haven't been any Pokémon recently, and the forest is forlorn.
If you see VAR(257, 0) in this forest, please let me know. That will be proof that Pokémon are living in this forest.
But--that VAR(257, 0) wasn't caught today, was it? Hoo! What I want to know is whether VAR(257, 0) is still living in the forest. The forest itself wants to know, too!
Did you notice the sky's beauty today? Tomorrow will be fine, too!
Let's go Berry picking together!
I need Berries for tomorrow's dinner, so go pick some, OK?
Let's have a Triple Battle with the Pokémon I have worked so hard to raise!
A Triple Battle is a new style of battle in which you use three Pokémon! Please get three Pokémon together to use in battle!
Oh... I wanted to see the Pokémon you've raised.
I'll work even harder raising my Pokémon!
I have always lived with these Pokémon. Hmm. How would you like to try a Triple Battle with me?
In order to have a Triple Battle, you need to have at least three Pokémon able to battle.
Oh... I hope I'll get to see them another time!
There are so many things to consider, but that is part of the fun of Triple Battles!

Have you noticed it's been getting warmer out lately? It's really nice. Hey, want to hang out for a while? If you have time, we could have a battle. Sound good?
All right! Lucky me, meeting a cool dude like you here. Let's battle right now!
Eep, my bad. I shouldn't have sprung that on you. Sorry! Forget I asked!
Wow! VAR(256, 0), you are so good at Pokémon battles! I want to ask you something else... Will you ride the Ferris wheel with me? I bet I get just as nervous asking a guy as a guy would asking a girl... You're OK with that, right? Good! C'mon!
Woo, that was fun! I've been wanting to ride this Ferris wheel for a long time. But you have to have two people, and I worried that if I went with my friend, she'd see how scared I was. Embarrassing! Then you came along! How lucky is that? OK, I'm still scared of heights, but... With you, it was a little bit easier. Um... Want to ride it again?
Hi, VAR(256, 0)! How are you? Want to hang out for a little while? We could have a Pokémon battle and ride the Ferris wheel together! This time, I kinda think I won't get scared!
Hee hee hee. Awesome! VAR(256, 0), let's have a Pokémon battle right now!
Oh. Oh well, that's how it goes. You do look kinda busy, VAR(256, 0).
Boy oh boy! VAR(256, 0), you are so good at Pokémon battles. No matter what I tried, it was all you! I'm done with Pokémon battles. So, shall we...ride the Ferris wheel? Eep, don't give me that look! I'll be fine! I'm calm, cool, and collected. Going to be absolutely fine this time! Uh-huh...
Aww... That was scary again. But, you know, VAR(256, 0), when I'm with you, I can almost enjoy being scared. It's like you make it safe anyway. Ha ha, maybe I'm weird. I like hanging out with you, VAR(256, 0). I'm looking forward to seeing you again!
It sure is getting nice out. The warmer it gets, the sleepier I feel! Oh, hey, do you have a minute? I want to ride the Ferris wheel, but it's two at a time, so I can't go by myself. You don't mind riding with me, do you? I don't have anything to give you in exchange, but I've got a great Pokémon I've been raising, so we could at least have an awesome battle.
You serious? Aww, thanks! You're awesome! Let me introduce my Pokémon. It rocks!
OK... Sorry to have bothered you. I'll find somebody who's not in a rush. Have a good one!
Er, VAR(256, 0)? Did I get that right? You rocked the house! I know I might not look it, but among my crowd, I've never lost a battle! Here I was thinking you're just cute, and then, seriously, you ruled the battle! That's even cooler! Right! Let's go and ride the Ferris wheel!
Wh-what? Why are you asking if something's wrong? I'm OK! I'm OK! It's all...good. Anyway, thanks, VAR(256, 0). I figured the Ferris wheel was kid stuff. The view was great... Gave me the shivers... I guess this ride is not too bad once in a while. In fact, let's ride it again sometime! See ya, VAR(256, 0)!
Oh, hi, VAR(256, 0)! W-wanna hang out...maybe... Feel like...having a Pokémon battle...and riding the Ferris wheel?
Did you say y-yes? Seriously! Cool! I knew you were awesome the minute I saw you! Ready to battle? Let's go!
Oh... Sorry. Well, when you're free, give me a shout sometime. See ya, VAR(256, 0)!
Ugh, ugh, ugh. As usual, you showed no mercy on me. Have you thought about trying to become the Champion? VAR(256, 0), I think that could be more than a dream for you. And I'll cheer you all the way! Yeah. Anyway... Let's go and ride the Ferris wheel!
Hmm-mmmm... Hm, hm, hmm... Ah, sorry, sorry... I was just thinking. I feel like...  When I am hanging out with you, time passes sooooo fast. I mean, I was thinking... How cruel time can be. Ha ha, forget I said anything! Thanks for the fun! Let's hang out again! Bye, VAR(256, 0)!
Hi, Trainer. Enjoying the summer? It's sure hot today. That's summer for ya. What? You wanna ride the Ferris wheel? It's for two at a time, so take a friend. What? You want me to ride it with you? Sure, I guess. I'll ride with ya... But you gotta win a Pokémon battle!
Sure enough. A little battle practice is a good way to spend a summer's day.
Oh well. Didn't feel like wasting my time riding a Ferris wheel anyway.
Nice job. I'm impressed. You and your Pokémon make a great team. Thanks, that was fun. See ya! What? That's not what I promised? You still want to ride the Ferris wheel? OK, sure enough, I guess...
It...uh...it was fun... Yeah, great view... What? I wasn't looking at the view? I was looking at my feet the whole time? What are you talking about? You think I'm scared of heights? Nah. That would be lame. I hike on mountains way higher than a silly little Ferris wh-wheel. C-catch ya later, Trainer!
Oh. You again. Summer's about over, you know. Time to put the hiking boots away. Wait... You want to ride the Ferris wheel again... Er... I guess...
If you want me to ride the Ferris wheel, you have to win a Pokémon battle first. What? Don't be ridiculous! It's not an excuse. Why would I need an excuse? No Hiker is scared of heights!
Oh, you changed your mind? Ha ha ha. Well, don't feel bad if you're scared. Lots of people are scared of heights. No need to be embarrassed about that. Me? Scared? Ya think? Me, a Hiker? I'm all that and a slice of pie. Got it? Good. S-see ya!
Y'know, kid, I figured you'd have Pokémon that were strong and tough! You're gonna be a big success! Yep, that was a fun battle. See ya! Wha...? You still wanna ride the Ferris wheel? Er... OK, let's go. Sigh...
I-it was... It was fun, eh? What? I what? I fainted?! Don't be ridiculous! I'm a Hiker! I'm not scared of heights. The only reason I was on the floor was because there was gum on my shoe. That's it, kid. I'm out! See ya!
I can't believe how hot it is! Can you? Say, are you interested in the Ferris wheel? I'm here for the same thing! The Ferris wheel seats two people, so, unfortunately, you can't ride alone. Let me think. Say, why don't you have a Pokémon battle with me? If you win the battle, I wouldn't mind riding with you. What do you say? Battle on?
Sure, sure... I'm interested in you because you seem to be so drawn to the Ferris wheel. That being said, I am an Ace Trainer. I won't compromise in battle.
All right. Just as well for you...
Gah. I hate to admit it... Losing to you is a complete surprise. Sigh... Looks can be deceiving, so they say... Fair enough. As I said earlier, I'll ride the Ferris wheel with you. Actually, it's my first Ferris wheel ride.
I had no idea. Call me stupid, but I didn't know how scary altitude could be. And...now I know. Thanks to you. I mean, thank you. Thank you for staying calm. Let me ask you something... Let's keep the whole altitude thing between you and me. And then, if you really want to ride the Ferris wheel again, I'll ride with you. Being an Ace Trainer means finding a way to conquer my fear.
Ah. H-hi. You're calling me out to ride the Ferris wheel again? You see how I'm acting like it's the simplest thing for me to conquer my fear? You can help me out. We'll battle. You win, and I'll ride the Ferris wheel with you again. Do you believe in me?
I knew it! I knew you would bet on me! If I didn't try to conquer this fear, then I really would be stupid. Let's get going!
I'm letting myself down here. This was a chance for me to conquer my weakness... to change my attitude about altitude...
My sincerest thanks for calling me out. I'd be a fool to hang on to this fear. When you believe in me, I believe in myself and in my ability to become a truly fearless Ace Trainer. It's all up to me... Watch it happen!
What are you grinning for? Am I imagining it, or are you laughing at me? Nice. Nice... Well, thanks for nothing. I am absolutely sure I will probably conquer my fear when the time comes. Because I am an Ace Trainer! But for now, I'm out. But if you keep thinking about riding the Ferris wheel with me again, and you just can't help yourself, come find me.
It's autumn already. Summer goes by so fast... Do you know what I mean? See the Ferris wheel? I've ridden it so many times, but now, summer's almost over and everyone's gone away... Gone to school, gone on journeys. And I'm still here, all alone. I'd like to ride one more time, but I need a friend to ride with. Do me a favor and ride with me? In return, I'll do my best in a Pokémon battle.
Aww. Ha ha. Thank you, young man. You have a kind heart. Well, let's have a Pokémon battle! Look out! I'll show you how it's done!
I see. Pardon me for being so out there. I'm sorry for intruding on you, a stranger...
Whoops... That seemed like an easy win! I did my best, though. Ha ha. Thanks for the lesson! It was fun. Well, now... Ready to ride the Ferris wheel?
Boo-hoo... This view reminds me of so many things... Sniff... Oh... I'm fine, I'm fine... Oh... I don't even know your name. Well, do you mind my asking...? Your name is VAR(256, 0)... Nice name. I'll be around here for a while. If you don't mind, I'd be happy if you rode the Ferris wheel with me again.
Oh, it's you. Hi. How have you been? Are you here to ride the Ferris wheel? I'd love to go again... We could have another Pokémon battle...
I'm so glad... Thank you... Your kindness really lifts my spirits. I know you're probably on your way somewhere. Everyone's always busy. VAR(256, 0), ready for my best battle? Let's see how it goes this time!
Whoops, I thought you looked too busy. Sorry to have stopped you. See you...
Oh, my. VAR(256, 0), you are really good at Pokémon battles. A battle with me is not challenging enough, is it? But you've been kind enough to battle with me anyway. I wish I had a...a little brother like you. Sorry, I'm just thinking out loud. Come on, let's ride the Ferris wheel again! I can't wait!
Boo-hoo... VAR(256, 0), your kindness has meant a lot to me. I don't know why I'm telling you this, but I wish I had a little brother like you. VAR(256, 0), I feel so alone these days. Thanks for spending time with me. I don't know if I'll see you again... I hope so, VAR(256, 0)! See you!
It's kinda getting cool... I betcha it's gonna get cold soon. Are you here to ride the Ferris wheel? Me, too. But you've gotta have two people. What do you wanna do? How about we have a Pokémon battle? Win, and I'll ride the wheel with you.
Just like that, you say yes? You're kinda confident, hey? Whatever... One battle will show what's what. Let's see what you got on your plate!
Ack. Whatever. I'll be around a while if you change your mind.
Whew... I was no match for you. Guess I was the one who was kinda more confident than I should have been! I figured I knew my Pokémon battles, but you showed me what is really what! OK, like I said, one ride on the Ferris wheel--over easy.
Haah! It was so relaxing to talk with you! It felt great to really let my hair down and have some girl talk for a change. That's what I think--sometimes you need another girl to talk to, and that's that. Hey, I'm gonna hang out here for a bit! If you feel like it, stop by and we'll talk some more!
Hey! We met the other day! Glad to see you! How're you doing? If you're not busy, let's hang out again. Why don't we have a Pokémon battle and chat while riding the Ferris wheel?
Yeah? You good? Yeah! For whatever reason, hanging out with you energized me like whoa! Ooh, let's have a Pokémon battle first!
Aww. Oh well, if you gotta motor... We'll have another chance to catch up sometime. Say hi next time, OK?
Sigh... I lost...again! You've got a knack for handling Pokémon, too. I'm just not in your league. And you're smart and pretty and nice... I gotta say, I'm totally jealous of you! Come on, at least we can ride the Ferris wheel together.
Aww... It's over already! I knew it. When I hang out with you, time just seems to zip by! I probably shouldn't say this, but I don't have a lot of friends... So finding someone to do stuff with and, you know, just talk and stuff... Well, it's really important to me! Um, thanks for being someone I can talk to. Anytime you wanna hang out, let me know!
It's already cold out. It would be so fun if it snowed. What's the matter? Do you wanna go for a ride? Oh, I get it. You can't ride 'cause you're all by yourself! They don't let you ride this Ferris wheel by yourself. Hey! I know what! I thought of something! I don't have anything to do until my dad comes back... We could play and have a Pokémon battle, if you want? If you play with me, then we can both ride the Ferris wheel!
You do? You want to play with me? Hee hee! I'm happy! Fun! Fun! Let's battle!
You don't want to play? Aww. I'm bored!
That was fun! Thank you! I knew you'd be strong 'cause you're big! My dad is very strong in Pokémon battles, too! But, he's been busy working, so he doesn't play with me. But you're gonna play with me! Next, let's ride the Ferris wheel!
Yay! That was cool! Did you have fun? It's been a while since I had fun. My dad doesn't take me anywhere lately. He just comes home and sleeps. So, I try to have fun here by myself until my dad comes back. Let's play some more!
VAR(256, 0)! I have a lot of time! Do you have time to play, too? Let's play! And let's have a Pokémon battle! And let's ride the Ferris wheel!
Tee hee! Yay! Thank you! VAR(256, 0)! Um, OK... First, let's have a Pokémon battle!
Booo! Are you busy? All grown-ups are busy. I am soooooo bored...
Tee hee! That was so fun! VAR(256, 0), you're really strong! I bet you're stronger than my dad in Pokémon battles! Um, OK, next! The Ferris wheel! The Ferris wheel! Hurry up! Let's go!
Hee hee! That was fun! You had fun, too. Right? Right? VAR(256, 0), you know what? I like you 'cause you play with me! And! You know what else? Um, it's... I don't like my dad lately. My dad and me, we're alone. I know he's working hard, but... I don't like my dad 'cause he doesn't play with me or anything. I want him to play with me more. Wait! You'll play with me again, right? Right? OK. See ya! Bye-bye!
Hi... Pretty chilly out, don't you think? Er... Well... I was wondering if you'd think about... Actually, this is the first time I've been out of the house in a long time. Since I'm out anyway, I want to get some exercise for my Pokémon. And I want to ride the Ferris wheel, too. So... Want to keep me company?
Really? Yes? OK! Thanks! You seem like a nice person. Let's start by giving our Pokémon a little warm-up battle for exercise.
OK. Totally understand. Didn't mean to intrude on your time.
Pant, pant... I'm crushed! It's been way too long since I got enough exercise. But... It was fun! My Pokémon also looks pretty happy, thanks to the exercise. Thank you for having a battle with us. Now, shall we ride the Ferris wheel? I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
VAR(256, 0), thank you. I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble. I don't get out much. My health has never been strong. It's been tremendous hanging out with you today... So, thanks again, VAR(256, 0). When I feel well enough, I'll be back. I'd love to hang out with you again.
Hello, VAR(256, 0). Good to see you! It's cold, eh? How are you doing? I feel good today, so I'm out for a walk. If you don't mind, VAR(256, 0), it would be nice to have a Pokémon battle and ride the Ferris wheel together... Let's hang out for a while, if that sounds good?
All right! I like that answer! Shall we begin with a little Pokémon exercise?
I see, alas. You are a busy person. When you have time, it would be nice to talk with you again.
Pant, pant... Still... Still...don't have the physical strength to keep up with you... But it's fun to have a battle... My Pokémon's also glad to see you. Thank you... Shall we ride the Ferris wheel now? Let's be on our way, VAR(256, 0)...
Again, sorry if I've caused you trouble. But, VAR(256, 0), since I started hanging out with you, I feel better... And, to be honest, VAR(256, 0), I am very happy to hang out with you. As long as you don't mind, I'd enjoy having you hang out with me another time. Again, thank you very much for today. See you, VAR(256, 0)...

Should I describe things in greater detail?
You will be asked to put up the Pokémon you are offering to trade. At that time, you will be asked what Pokémon you would like in return. If another player offers your desired Pokémon in return for your offered Pokémon, the trade will go through.
You may search among the Pokémon that are offered by other Trainers. They will all identify what Pokémon their Trainers want back in return. If you find one that you want, you must provide us with the kind of Pokémon wanted in return.

In GTS Negotiations, you set the trading conditions based on what kinds of Pokémon you'd like to trade. If you find a person with matching conditions, you may proceed to a Negotiation Trade with that person. In order to trade, you need to have two or more Pokémon in your party.
Should I describe things in greater detail?
In a Negotiation Trade, each person offers three Pokémon to trade. Then, each person will choose one of the other person's three Pokémon.
You can set three conditions in a Negotiation Trade: the level of Pokémon to trade, the Pokémon you want to receive, and the Pokémon up for offer. You may trade with a person whose conditions match yours, or choose Trade Rendezvous to try another trade with a previous trading partner.

A Random Matchup is a battle with other Pokémon fans from around the world. There are five kinds of Random Matchups: Single, Double, Triple, Rotation, and Launcher. Also, Random Matchups have two modes: Free mode and Rating mode. In Free mode, everyone can participate in battles freely. In Rating mode, you may participate in battles after you set Game Sync, access the Pokémon Global Link website with your computer, and register your Game Sync ID. http://www.pokemon-gl.com/ (Pokémon Global Link)

Special Rules
Understood
Free mode is for casual battles against other Pokémon fans around the world. Feel free to challenge it!
Rating mode is recommended for those who want to master battles. When communication is established, you are likely to battle against a person with a similar Rating. Your Rating starts at 1500. When you win, it goes up. When you lose, it goes down. So the higher your Rating is, the stronger you are as a Trainer! There's one thing you should be careful about in Rating mode. Your record and Rating will be erased if you connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with a different DS System. So please be careful if you switch!
There are several special rules for Random Matchups. Any Pokémon higher than Lv. 50 will be set to that level for the battle. Pokémon nicknames won't be used. You have a limited time to choose Pokémon for a battle and to give orders to your Pokémon during the battle. Don't exceed the time limit, or your Pokémon and its moves will be chosen for you! There's also a time limit on the battle. The winner will be determined when time runs out, even if both sides still have Pokémon standing.
